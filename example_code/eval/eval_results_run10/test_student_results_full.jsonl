Endotracheal intubation may be needed if the patient's airway is compromised or if there is a risk of aspiration, but this is not the first step.

I have huge respect for the way this film was made but, much like The Matrix, I feel like people attach way more importance to this movie than it deserves.\nReview 2: The film tells the story of men who cannot adapt to the social order in today's world, under the leadership of Tyler Durden, to discover their natural instinct, masculinity, and to escape from their unhappy lives.\nReview 3: Despite a good theme, great acting and important messages that this movie convey in an unorthodox way, I think it fails to connect the audience with the storyline and leaves him in a world of confusion.

{"index": 113, "task": "infobench", "prompt": "Discuss the origins and history of the word that has been given to you.\n\noblique", "student_output": "The word *oblique* has its origins in Latin, where it comes from the word *obliquus*, meaning \"slanting\" or \"inclined at an angle.\" The root *ob-* means \"toward\" or \"against,\" and *-liquus* is related to the idea of \"slant\" or \"leaning.\" Together, *obliquus* describes something that is not straight or perpendicular but rather angled or slanted.\n\nIn classical Latin, *obliquus* was used to describe a direction that was not directly forward or backward, but at an angle\u2014such as a slant or a diagonal. This concept was later adopted into Middle English through Latin influence, particularly in legal, geometric, and architectural contexts. By the 16th century, *oblique* was being used in English to describe things that were not directly aligned or straight, such as oblique angles in geometry or oblique relationships in society.\n\nOver time, the meaning of *oblique* has expanded. In modern usage, it can refer to:\n- A slanting or diagonal direction (geometric sense),\n- A person or situation that is indirect, ambiguous, or not straightforward (e.g., an oblique comment),\n- A direction that is not direct or straight (e.g., an oblique approach to a problem).\n\nThe word's evolution reflects the broader use of Latin-derived terms in English to describe spatial, social, and abstract relationships.

It\u2019s not just fine\u2014it\u2019s magnetic, sticky, and it clings to everything. It infiltrated our suits, our instruments, even our food storage. We had to develop special cleaning protocols. But the real challenge was the mental toll.

But the most surprising find was a network of subsurface ice deposits beneath the regolith. It suggests Mars might have had a more stable climate in the past, and could even support future human settlements.  \n\n---\n\n**Journalist:** How did you maintain your mental and physical health during the mission?  \n\n**Astronaut:** We had strict routines\u2014exercise, sleep cycles, and daily meditation sessions. We also maintained contact with Earth through regular video calls with our families. One thing that helped was sharing stories. We\u2019d tell each other jokes, memories, even old songs.

Introduction  \nJohn Smith and Jane Smith were married on January 1, 2010. The marriage has lasted for 13 years and includes one child, Emily Smith. The parties have reached a mutual agreement to dissolve their marriage on the terms outlined below. This agreement includes provisions for the equitable division of assets and liabilities, child custody, visitation, and child support.  \n\nII. Division of Assets and Liabilities  \nAll marital assets and liabilities are to be divided equally between John Smith and Jane Smith. This includes real estate, bank accounts, retirement funds, vehicles, and outstanding debts. Each party shall receive 50% ownership of all jointly acquired property and shall be responsible for 50% of any joint liabilities.  \n\nIII. Child Custody and Visitation  \n\n1. Primary Custody:  \nJane Smith shall be granted primary physical custody of the child, Emily Smith, who is currently 10 years old. This decision is supported by the following three factors:  \n\n   a. **Child\u2019s Age and Developmental Needs**  \n      Emily is 10 years old, a stage at which emotional and psychological stability is critical. Jane has demonstrated consistent, nurturing, and responsive parenting behaviors, including regular involvement in school activities, extracurriculars, and emotional support. A stable home environment is essential at this developmental stage, and Jane\u2019s established routines and caregiving presence are more conducive to Emily\u2019s well-being.  \n\n   b. **Employment and Income Status**  \n      Jane Smith is a full-time high school teacher with a stable annual income of $75,000. Her consistent employment provides a reliable financial foundation for the child\u2019s needs. In contrast, John Smith is currently unemployed and has been without work for the past 18 months due to a career transition. Jane\u2019s employment ensures that the child\u2019s daily needs\u2014including education, healthcare, and extracurricular activities\u2014are reliably met.  \n\n   c. **Education Level and Future Earning Capacity**  \n      Jane holds a Master\u2019s degree in Early Childhood Education and has a strong track record of professional growth. Her future earning capacity is robust, with potential for advancement to a principal or instructional lead role, which could result in an annual income of $90,000 to $120,000. In contrast, John holds a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Business Administration and has limited post-secondary advancement opportunities. His future earning capacity is projected to remain stagnant at approximately $40,000 annually. This supports Jane\u2019s ability to provide long-term financial stability for the child.  \n\n2. Visitation Rights:  \nJohn Smith shall have reasonable visitation rights as follows:  \n- Every other weekend (Friday evening to Sunday evening)  \n- Two consecutive weekly holidays (e.g., Thanksgiving, Christmas)  \n- One full week of visitation during summer vacation (July 1\u2013July 14)  \n- One weekend per month during school breaks (e.g., spring break, winter break)  \nVisitation shall occur at John\u2019s residence or at a mutually agreed-upon location. All visitation must be coordinated at least 72 hours in advance.  \n\n3. Child Support:  \nJane Smith shall provide child support to John Smith in the amount of $1,200 per month. This amount is calculated based on the state\u2019s child support guidelines, Emily\u2019s needs, and the income disparity between the parties. The support shall be paid directly to John Smith\u2019s designated account and shall remain in effect until Emily reaches the age of 18 or completes higher education, whichever occurs first.  \n\nIV.

The One Ring \u2014 a book-like object.  \nDoor? Possibly the door to Mordor?  \nLightning?

The eagle is a different animal.\n\nIn Harry Potter, there's no eagle.\n\nIn *The Lord of the Rings*, there's the eagle \u2014 and a wizard (Gandalf), a book (The Ring), a door (the gate to Mordor), and lightning (the lightning in the sky, or the lightning bolt from the One Ring)?\n\nBut the lightning bolt is more associated with the **Harry Potter** wand.\n\nWait \u2014 the lightning bolt is a key symbol of Harry Potter \u2014 the lightning bolt scar.\n\nSo:  \n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f \u2014 wizard (Gandalf or Harry)  \n\ud83d\udeaa \u2014 door to the castle or to a hidden place  \n\ud83d\udcda \u2014 books of magic  \n\ud83e\udd85 \u2014 owl (Hedwig) \u2014 this is a strong indicator  \n\u26a1 \u2014 lightning bolt (Harry's scar)\n\nThis strongly points to **Harry Potter**.\n\nBut which movie?\n\nThe emojis don't specify a title \u2014 just the story.\n\nBut the most likely movie based on these emojis is:\n\n\ud83d\udc49 **Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone** (also known as *Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone* in the UK)\n\nFinal answer:\n\n**Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone**", "gold_answer": null, "score": 0.0, "eval_details": {"error": "Skipping infobench"}}

If breathing is difficult, seek medical attention.  \n- **Skin contact**: Wash thoroughly with soap and water. No specific treatment required unless irritation persists.  \n- **Eye contact**: Rinse gently with water for at least 15 minutes, then seek medical advice if discomfort continues.  \n- **Ingestion**: Do not induce vomiting. Drink water if conscious and able. Seek medical attention if symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness occur.  \n- **Note**: Ingestion of large quantities may require medical evaluation, especially in individuals with pre-existing health conditions.\n\n---  \n*This SDS is based on standard chemical safety information and is intended for general use.

The 5-4-3-2-1 technique interrupts this cycle by shifting focus from internal, anxious thoughts to external, tangible sensory experiences.\n\n- **Sensory Engagement:** By anchoring attention to the present moment through the five senses, the brain is pulled away from rumination and into the here and now.\n- **Neurological Impact:** This activates the parasympathetic nervous system, which promotes relaxation and reduces the production of stress hormones like cortisol.\n- **Cognitive Reset:** Naming sensory details forces your mind to engage in a concrete, observable reality, which counters the abstract, often irrational thoughts that fuel anxiety.\n\n**Tips for Use:**\n- Practice this exercise during moments of rising anxiety\u2014before a meeting, when feeling overwhelmed, or during a panic attack.\n- Use it as a daily mindfulness anchor to build resilience over time.\n- Combine it with breathing exercises for even greater effectiveness.\n\nThis simple, accessible mental exercise empowers individuals to regain control during anxious moments by grounding themselves in the physical world.", "gold_answer": null, "score": 0.0, "eval_details": {"error": "Skipping infobench"}}

Below are the detailed steps required to construct and operate the project safely and effectively.\n\n---\n\n**Materials Needed:**\n- One empty beer can (aluminum or steel, clean and dry)\n- A small piece of cardboard or plastic (to serve as a piston)\n- A rubber band or small piece of tape\n- A small piece of wire or a paperclip (to act as a valve or guide)\n- A small amount of water\n- A heat source (e.g., a candle, stove, or hot plate \u2014 use with caution)\n- A flat surface (to place the can on)\n- A container or cup to hold water\n- A small piece of foil (optional, for insulation)\n\n---\n\n**Step-by-Step Instructions:**\n\n1. **Prepare the Beer Can:**\n   - Clean the beer can thoroughly and dry it completely.\n   - Cut a small hole (about 1 cm in diameter) near the bottom of the can, near the base, using a knife or scissors. This hole will serve as the steam exit point.\n   - Cut a small flap of cardboard or plastic (about 2\u20133 cm wide) and place it at the top of the can, slightly overlapping the opening. This will act as a piston cover.\n\n2. **Create the Piston:**\n   - Cut a small piece of cardboard or plastic (about 2 cm wide and 1 cm tall) to serve as the piston.\n   - Place the piston into the opening of the can so it fits snugly and can move up and down with minimal friction.\n\n3. **Assemble the Valve Mechanism:**\n   - Bend a small piece of wire or use a paperclip to create a simple valve.\n   - Place the wire or paperclip across the top of the can, just above the piston, so that it can be pushed down to open or close the top opening.\n   - Tape or secure the wire so it can move freely but remains in place when not in use.\n\n4. **Fill the Can with Water:**\n   - Pour a small amount of water (about 1\u20132 tablespoons) into the can. Do not overfill \u2014 leave space for steam to expand.\n\n5. **Heat the Can (Carefully):**\n   - Place the can on a heat source (e.g., a candle, stove, or hot plate) \u2014 **only use under adult supervision**.\n   - Heat the can slowly and steadily for 1\u20132 minutes until the water begins to boil and steam is produced.\n   - As steam builds up, it will push the piston upward, creating a small mechanical movement.\n\n6. **Observe the Motion:**\n   - As the steam pressure increases, the piston will rise, and you may hear a soft hissing sound.\n   - When the steam pressure builds enough, the piston will move up and down in a small oscillating motion, simulating a basic steam engine cycle.\n\n7. **Allow the Engine to Cool:**\n   - Once the motion stops, remove the can from the heat source.\n   - Let it cool completely before handling.\n\n8. **Safety Precautions:**\n   - Never use open flames near the can if it is not directly in a safe, controlled environment.\n   - Do not touch the can while it is hot or during heating.\n   - Supervise children at all times during the experiment.\n   - Avoid using the can if it has any dents or damage \u2014 it may fail under pressure.\n\n---\n\n**Scientific Principles Demonstrated:**\n- **Thermodynamics:** Heat energy is converted into mechanical work.\n- **Pressure:** Steam builds pressure", "gold_answer": null, "score": 0.0, "eval_details": {"error": "Skipping infobench"}}

Born into a modest Virginia gentry family, Washington\u2019s formative years were spent in a world where social expectations and familial duty were paramount. Martha, a woman of strong character and cultivated refinement, brought stability and grace to their shared life after Washington married her in 1759. Her guidance in managing the household and her emphasis on virtue, duty, and the importance of family helped shape Washington\u2019s sense of responsibility. Martha\u2019s own experience as a widow and her ability to maintain composure during difficult times provided Washington with a model of resilience. Their marriage, rooted in mutual respect and shared values, became a foundation for his leadership\u2014teaching him that personal integrity and emotional balance were essential to effective governance.\n\n**Revolutionary War Leadership**  \nDuring the American Revolutionary War, Washington\u2019s leadership was not only a product of military strategy but also of the personal strength he drew from his relationship with Martha. As he led the Continental Army through years of hardship, including the harsh winter at Valley Forge, Martha\u2019s unwavering support\u2014sending letters of encouragement, managing the household, and advocating for his well-being\u2014provided him with emotional sustenance. Her role extended beyond the domestic sphere; she was a quiet but powerful force in maintaining his morale and sense of purpose. In moments of doubt or exhaustion, Washington often reflected on Martha\u2019s steadfastness, which reinforced his resolve to serve the cause of independence. This emotional anchor helped him endure the war\u2019s grueling challenges and emerge as a symbol of unity and perseverance. Their partnership exemplified the idea that leadership requires both courage and compassion.\n\n**Presidency**  \nIn his presidency, Washington\u2019s personal relationship with Martha continued to influence his public conduct. Though he served as a national leader, he often referred to her in private as a moral compass. Martha\u2019s influence is evident in his commitment to a strong, united republic, his emphasis on civic virtue, and his belief in the importance of a balanced and humane government. After his presidency, he retired to Mount Vernon, where he and Martha lived in quiet dignity, preserving their legacy of mutual respect and shared values. Their marriage, which endured for over 40 years, became a symbol of the private virtues that underpinned public service. In the end, Martha Washington\u2019s steadfast presence in Washington\u2019s life helped mold a leader not only of war and statecraft but of character and conscience. Her quiet strength laid the emotional groundwork for a presidency defined by integrity, restraint, and service to the nation.", "gold_answer": null, "score": 0.0, "eval_details": {"error": "Skipping infobench"}}
