Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: Three weeks ago a 45-year-old man was admitted to the hospital because of frostbite of both feet. He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet. All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot. Which of the following is the most appropriate treatment?\n Options:\nA. Amputation\nB. Application of topical collagenase\nC. Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes\nD. Hyperbaric oxygen\nAnswer:",
