        "text": "[Exhibition Catalog: \"Form & Forge \u2013 Sculptures of the Modern Era\"]\n\n1. **Auguste Rodin**  \nRodin (1840\u20131917) revolutionized sculpture with expressive, dynamic forms. Mastery of bronze and wax enabled emotional depth and textured surfaces. Works like *The Thinker* convey inner tension through fluid, organic movement, challenging traditional ideals of balance and idealism.\n\n2. **Henry Moore**  \nMoore (1903\u20131986) pioneered abstract, organic forms in bronze and stone. His large-scale sculptures, such as *Reclining Figure*, use negative space and soft curves to explore human presence and nature. Techniques emphasize fluidity and contemplation, blending form and emotion.\n\n3. **Isamu Noguchi**  \nNoguchi (1904\u20131988) fused Japanese aesthetics with modernist abstraction. Using wood, steel, and stone, he crafted minimalist, meditative sculptures like *The Curve*. His mastery lies in integrating natural materials with sculptural rhythm, creating harmonious, site-responsive forms.\n\n4. **Alexander Calder**  \nCalder (1901\u20131976) transformed sculpture through mobiles and stabiles. Using steel and wire, he explored motion and balance. *Mobile No. 1* exemplifies his dynamic technique\u2014light, suspended forms that shift with air currents, blending art and physics into kinetic expression.\n\n5. **Anish Kapoor**  \nKapoor (b. 1954) dominates with polished stainless steel and concrete. *Cloud Gate* (the \"Bean\") showcases reflective surfaces and monumental scale. His mastery lies in material play\u2014light, depth, and negative space\u2014producing immersive, emotional experiences through smooth, seamless forms.",
