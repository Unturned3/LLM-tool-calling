She has type 2 diabetes mellitus, a long history of hypertension, and chronic renal failure presumed secondary to diabetes mellitus and hypertension. Reversible causes of renal failure have been excluded. She underwent a tonsillectomy at age 9 years and a laparoscopic cholecystectomy at age 68 years. Serum creatinine concentration on admission was 6.0 mg/dL. Her current therapy includes a low-sodium, low-protein American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet, enalapril, and acetaminophen. She is a retired seamstress. She and her husband live on a farm 90 miles from the nearest dialysis facility. In considering longterm treatment options for this patient, which of the following is the most appropriate factor to consider?\n Options:\nA. Her eligibility to receive Medicare\nB. Her history of an abdominal operation\nC. Her history of arthritis\nD. Her suitability for home dialysis\nAnswer:",
