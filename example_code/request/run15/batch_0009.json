        "prompt": "The following is a multiple choice question (with answers) about  professional medicine.  Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 2-year-old boy is brought to the office by his mother for follow-up of a chromosome analysis done 1 month ago. The child has minor dysmorphic features, and growth and developmental delay. Chromosome analysis showed a small unbalanced chromosome translocation, with extra chromosomal material at the tip of chromosome 3. The cytogenetics laboratory requested blood samples from both parents for follow-up studies. The parents are divorced, and the mother has custody of the child. The relationship between the parents is hostile. The mother has been tested and has normal chromosomes without evidence of translocation. At today's visit, she reacts angrily when the issue of contacting the child's father for testing is raised. She states that he abandoned them and that he has no interest in his child. She refuses to cooperate in contacting the father, who could be a translocation carrier. You do not know the father, but an office worker told you that he lives in a nearby town. The mother says that he is living with a new girlfriend. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n Options:\nA. Attempt to identify the father's physician and work with that physician to obtain chromosome studies on the father\nB. Contact the father by telephone and arrange for him to give a blood sample at a local hospital\nC. Document your attempts to work with the mother but proceed no further, since you have no physician-patient relationship with the father\nD. Help the mother deal with her anger and educate her regarding the potential benefit to her son and others if the father's chromosome studies are done\nAnswer:",

As her AP History and English teacher for three years, I have witnessed Maya\u2019s intellectual curiosity, resilience, and leadership firsthand.  \n\nMaya consistently excels academically, earning top grades in challenging courses including AP Calculus and AP Environmental Science. However, her most remarkable quality is her ability to apply knowledge meaningfully. In our school\u2019s annual service-learning project, Maya led a team of students in developing a community garden to address food insecurity in a local neighborhood. She researched sustainable practices, coordinated with local farmers, and presented her findings to city officials. Her initiative, creativity, and empathy transformed a modest idea into a tangible, lasting solution.  \n\nBeyond academics, Maya is deeply involved in debate, student government, and mentoring younger students. She balances these responsibilities with a strong work ethic and emotional intelligence, always demonstrating compassion and integrity.  \n\nMaya possesses the maturity, drive, and vision to thrive in a rigorous college environment. I have no doubt she will make significant contributions to your academic community. I wholeheartedly recommend her for admission.  \n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Full Name]  \nAP History and English Teacher",
