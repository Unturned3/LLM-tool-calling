He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n Options:\nA.
