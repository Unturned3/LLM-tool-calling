The immediate management of acute variceal bleeding in a patient with cirrhosis involves stabilizing the patient, administering intravenous fluids, and performing urgent endoscopy to identify and control the source of bleeding. Endoscopy is both diagnostic and therapeutic in this setting, allowing for interventions such as band ligation or sclerotherapy.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n Options:\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\nAnswer:",

Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected.
