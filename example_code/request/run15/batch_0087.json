This builds trust, validates experiences, and fosters connection across age groups with minimal resources.  \n\nActivity 2: Weekly Gratitude Jar  \nFamily members write down things they\u2019re grateful for and place them in a jar. Regularly opening it promotes positivity, shared appreciation, and open communication.  \n\nActivity 3: Cooking Together  \nPrepare a simple meal or snack as a team. Involving all ages in planning and cooking builds cooperation, teaches responsibility, and enhances communication through shared tasks.  \n\nActivity 4: Nature Scavenger Hunt  \nCreate a simple list of natural items (e.g., a leaf, a rock) and go on a walk. It encourages bonding, active communication, and shared discovery in a fun, low-cost way.  \n\nActivity 5: Family Memory Wall  \nDisplay photos, drawings, or notes from past events. Creating and updating it together strengthens emotional connections and provides a visual record of shared experiences.",
