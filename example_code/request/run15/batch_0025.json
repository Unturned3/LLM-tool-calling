There are also themes of crime, corruption, and moral ambiguity. Some scenes may be disturbing for younger viewers. While the film is not explicitly graphic or inappropriate in a sexual or vulgar sense, the tone and content may be too intense or complex for young children.\n\nRecommendation: Parents should consider the child's maturity level. Children aged 12 and older may be better equipped to understand and process the film\u2019s themes and violence. For younger children, it is advisable to avoid or view with a parent.",
