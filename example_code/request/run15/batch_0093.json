        "text": "The word *oblique* has its origins in Latin, specifically from the word *obliquus*, which means \"slanted\" or \"inclined at an angle.\" The root *ob-* means \"toward\" or \"against,\" and *-liquus* is derived from *liquere*, meaning \"to turn\" or \"to bend.\" Together, *obliquus* describes something that is bent or turned away from a straight path or perpendicular direction.\n\nIn classical Latin, *obliquus* was used in various contexts, such as describing angles in geometry or the direction of a path. The term entered Middle English via Old French (*oblique*), where it retained its meaning of \"slanted\" or \"angled.\" Over time, the word expanded in usage to describe not just physical angles but also positions, attitudes, or directions that are not direct or straightforward.\n\nIn modern usage, *oblique* is used in multiple contexts:\n- In geometry: to describe a line or surface that is not perpendicular to another.\n- In language: to describe a statement or reference that is indirect or not directly stated (e.g., \"an oblique comment\").\n- In music: to describe a musical key or tone that is not in a direct or major/minor mode.\n- In philosophy or social behavior: to describe a stance or attitude that is not fully aligned with a norm or direct position.\n\nThe evolution of *oblique* reflects how language adapts to convey both physical and abstract concepts. Its journey from a geometric term to a term for indirectness illustrates the flexibility and richness of English vocabulary.",
