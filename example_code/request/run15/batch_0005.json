Does not react with water or air at room temperature.\n\n---\n\n**2) Potential Hazards**  \nSodium chloride is generally considered non-hazardous under normal conditions.  \n- **Health effects**: Ingestion of large quantities may cause electrolyte imbalance, particularly in individuals with pre-existing conditions such as kidney disease.  \n- **Environmental impact**: High concentrations in water bodies can disrupt aquatic ecosystems by altering salinity levels.  \n- **Fire and explosion risk**: No flammable or explosive properties.  \n- **Toxicity**: Low acute toxicity; not classified as a hazardous substance under GHS or OSHA standards.  \n\nNo significant respiratory, skin, or eye irritation is expected from normal handling.\n\n---\n\n**3) Handling and Storage Procedures**  \n- Handle with standard personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves and safety glasses, especially in high-temperature or humid environments.  \n- Store in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated area, away from moisture and direct sunlight.  \n- Use sealed containers to prevent moisture absorption and contamination.  \n- Avoid contact with food-grade surfaces to prevent cross-contamination.  \n- Keep away from incompatible materials (e.g., strong oxidizers), though no known reactivity exists.  \n- Label containers clearly with the name and date of receipt.\n\n---\n\n**4) First-Aid Measures**  \n- **Inhalation**: If inhaled, move to fresh air. If breathing is difficult, seek medical attention. No specific treatment is required.  \n- **Skin contact**: Wash with water and mild soap. No irritation is typically observed.  \n- **Eye contact**: Rinse gently with water for at least 15 minutes, then seek medical advice if discomfort persists.  \n- **Ingestion**: If consumed, do not induce vomiting. Seek medical attention if large amounts are ingested or if symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness occur.  \n\nNote: Ingestion of large quantities may lead to dehydration or electrolyte imbalance, especially in vulnerable populations.  \n\n---  \n*This Safety Data Sheet is based on standard chemical safety guidelines and is applicable to table salt (NaCl) under normal conditions.*",

Ordinary world \u2013 A quiet, isolated coastal town where 18-year-old Maya lives a routine life, attending school and working part-time at the local fish market.  \n2. Call to adventure \u2013 A mysterious message arrives on her phone: a map to an abandoned lighthouse off the coast, claiming it holds a forgotten truth about her family\u2019s past.  \n3. Refusal of the call \u2013 Maya dismisses the message as a prank, convinced her parents\u2019 stories about the lighthouse are just myths.  \n4. Meeting with the mentor \u2013 She meets Old Man Elias, a reclusive historian who once studied the lighthouse, and he warns her that the truth may cost her everything.  \n5. Crossing the first threshold \u2013 Maya decides to go alone, leaving her town behind and boarding a small boat to the lighthouse at dawn.  \n\n**Act II: Initiation**  \n6. Tests, allies, and enemies \u2013 Maya faces stormy seas, navigational errors, and encounters a rogue fisherman who warns her not to go further. She forms a tentative alliance with a young marine biologist, Lila, who shares her curiosity.  \n7. Approach to the inmost cave \u2013 They reach the lighthouse, now partially collapsed, and discover a hidden room containing old journals and family photographs.  \n8. The ordeal \u2013 Maya learns that her father was a researcher who disappeared during a storm years ago, and the lighthouse was meant to protect a secret about climate change and coastal erosion. The truth is dangerous\u2014those who knew it were silenced.  \n9. Reward \u2013 Maya finds a journal entry from her father: a message of hope and a warning to pass on the knowledge. She gains clarity about her identity and purpose.  \n\n**Act III: Return**  \n10. The road back \u2013 Maya returns to the town, but the community is skeptical. She faces resistance from her parents, who fear the truth will disrupt their lives.  \n11. The resurrection \u2013 In a confrontation, Maya stands up to her parents, revealing the truth not with anger, but with courage and compassion. She chooses to speak openly, not to destroy, but to awaken.  \n12. Return with the elixir \u2013 Maya returns to the lighthouse at night, places the journal in a safe, and leaves a message: \u201cThe truth is not a weapon. It is a bridge.\u201d She becomes a voice for environmental awareness, and the town begins to change.",

A digital control strategy with adaptive feedback is implemented to ensure stability.  \n\nExperiment:  \n- Hardware setup: A prototype converter is built with a 12 V to 48 V conversion range and tested under real-world load conditions.  \n- Load variation tests: Efficiency and output ripple are measured across 10% to 100% of rated load.  \n- Temperature and thermal stress tests: Converter performance is monitored under continuous operation at maximum load for 24 hours.  \n\nAnalysis: Data from experiments show a 95% efficiency at full load, reduced output ripple by 60%, and stable performance across temperature gradients.  \n\nConclusion: The proposed topology achieves superior efficiency and robustness in renewable energy applications, demonstrating its potential for real-world deployment.",
