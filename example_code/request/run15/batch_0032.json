        "text": "**Key Study Notes and Important Points in the History of the United States**\n\n1. **Pre-Columbian Era and Indigenous Peoples**  \n   - Before European contact, the Americas were home to diverse Indigenous civilizations (e.g., Mississippian, Ancestral Puebloans, Iroquois, Aztec, and Maya).  \n   - These societies had complex political systems, agriculture, trade, and cultural achievements.  \n   - European contact began in the late 15th century with explorers like Columbus (1492), leading to colonization and displacement of Native populations.\n\n2. **Colonial Period (1607\u20131776)**  \n   - British colonization began with Jamestown (1607), followed by Plymouth (1620).  \n   - Colonies formed distinct regions: New England (New England Puritans), Middle Colonies (fertile, diverse), and Southern Colonies (plantation economy, cash crops like tobacco and rice).  \n   - Key developments:  \n     - Navigation Acts (1651) restricted trade.  \n     - Bacon\u2019s Rebellion (1676) highlighted tensions between colonists and Native Americans.  \n     - Enlightenment ideas (freedom, rights, government) influenced colonial thought.  \n   - 1765\u20131776: Growing resistance to British policies (e.g., Stamp Act, Tea Act, Intolerable Acts) led to the American Revolution.\n\n3. **American Revolution (1775\u20131783)**  \n   - Causes: Taxation without representation, lack of political rights, British military actions.  \n   - Key events:  \n     - Battles of Lexington and Concord (1775) \u2013 start of war.  \n     - Declaration of Independence (1776) \u2013 formal break from Britain.  \n     - Treaty of Paris (1783) \u2013 Britain recognized U.S. independence.  \n   - Outcome: The United States became a sovereign nation.\n\n4. **Constitutional Era (1787\u20131800)**  \n   - Constitutional Convention (1787): Drafted the U.S. Constitution, establishing a federal system with separation of powers (executive, legislative, judicial).  \n   - Ratification: Required 9 out of 13 states to adopt.  \n   - First U.S. President: George Washington (1789\u20131797).  \n   - Key early policies:  \n     - Federalist vs. Anti-Federalist debates over individual rights and federal power.  \n     - Bill of Rights (1791): First 10 amendments to protect civil liberties.\n\n5. **Expansion and Manifest Destiny (1800\u20131860)**  \n   - Westward expansion driven by ideology of Manifest Destiny (\"God-given right to expand\").  \n   - Key events:  \n     - Louisiana Purchase (1803) \u2013 doubled U.S. size.  \n     - Missouri Compromise (1820) \u2013 maintained balance of free and slave states.  \n     - Indian Removal Act (1830) \u2013 led to forced relocation (e.g., Trail of Tears).  \n     - Texas Annexation (1845), Mexican-American War (1846\u20131848) \u2013 gained California, New Mexico.  \n     - Oregon Territory dispute resolved by 1846 (U.S. gets Oregon).  \n\n6. **Antebellum Period (1820\u20131860)**  \n   - Rise of democracy, industrialization, and market economy.  \n   - Expansion of slavery: Southern economy relied heavily on slave labor.",
