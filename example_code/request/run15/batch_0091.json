He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?\n Options:\nA. Carvedilol\nB. Furosemide\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Phentolamine\nAnswer:",

The pressure in the neck is greater than the pressure in the knee because of the increase in pressure head\nB. The pressure in the neck is equal to the pressure in the knee because of the equal dynamic pressure according to the continuity equation\nC. The pressure in the knee is greater than the pressure in the neck because of the increase in pressure head\nD. An accurate comparison cannot be given without knowledge of the fluid\u2019s density and viscosity\nAnswer:",
