Establish co-management frameworks where Indigenous communities lead the stewardship of cultural sites and traditional lands, ensuring decisions reflect local knowledge and values.  \n2. Integrate traditional ecological knowledge into sustainable development projects\u2014such as agroforestry or renewable energy\u2014through formal partnerships and capacity-building programs that respect intellectual property rights.  \n3. Create a national cultural heritage fund to support Indigenous-led initiatives in education, tourism, and conservation, with transparent funding mechanisms and community oversight boards.  \n\nThese measures empower Indigenous peoples as stewards of their heritage while aligning development with environmental sustainability. By prioritizing community autonomy, cultural integrity, and equitable benefit-sharing, policies can prevent the commodification of cultural practices and ensure long-term resilience. Sustainable development becomes not just economically viable, but ethically grounded when Indigenous voices shape both planning and implementation. This approach fosters mutual respect, strengthens intergenerational ties, and protects intangible heritage such as languages, oral histories, and spiritual practices. Ultimately, safeguarding cultural heritage and promoting sustainable development are not mutually exclusive\u2014they are interdependent when guided by Indigenous leadership and inclusive governance.",
