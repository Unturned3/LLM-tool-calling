Simpson was tried for two accounts of murder in 1994. Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a restaurant waiter, Ron Goldman.\n\nSimpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, that many referred to as the Dream Team. It included famous names like Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, and Robert Kardashian.\n\nCochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence, and he alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe trial lasted 11 months, and Simpson was found not guilty. Since then, it is often referred to as \u201cthe trial of the century\u201d and there have been television series, movies, and documentaries made about the trial.\n\nHowever, the families of the deceased filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. The jury unanimously found him guilty for both deaths, and awarded the families $33.5 million for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMany feel the justice system prevailed 13 years later when Simpson was convicted and sentenced on robbery and weapons charges.\nGeneration:",
