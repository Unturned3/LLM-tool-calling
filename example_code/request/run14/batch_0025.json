        "text": "Yes, children can watch *The Dark Knight* (2008) with parental guidance, but it is generally not recommended for very young children.\n\nReasons it may be inappropriate for young children:\n- Contains violent scenes, including gunfights, explosions, and graphic depictions of crime and chaos.\n- Features intense action and a dark, mature tone that may be overwhelming or frightening for younger viewers.\n- Includes themes of violence, corruption, and moral ambiguity, which may be difficult for young children to understand.\n\nThe film is rated PG-13 by the MPAA for violence and intense action. While it has strong themes and storytelling, its tone and content are more suited for older audiences (typically age 13 and up). Parents should consider the maturity level of their child when deciding whether to watch it together.",
