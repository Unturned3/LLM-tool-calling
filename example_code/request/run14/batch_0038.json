        "text": "To determine how many electrons in gold (Au) have a quantum number \u2113 = 2, we need to understand what \u2113 = 2 corresponds to in electron configurations.\n\nThe azimuthal quantum number \u2113 determines the subshell:\n- \u2113 = 0 \u2192 s subshell\n- \u2113 = 1 \u2192 p subshell\n- \u2113 = 2 \u2192 d subshell\n- \u2113 = 3 \u2192 f subshell\n\nSo, we are looking for electrons in d orbitals (\u2113 = 2).\n\nGold (Au) has an atomic number of 79, so its electron configuration is:\n\n[ Xe ] 4f\u00b9\u2074 5d\u00b9\u2070 6s\u00b9\n\nNow, let's break down the configuration:\n- 4f\u00b9\u2074 \u2192 \u2113 = 3 (f orbital) \u2192 not relevant\n- 5d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 \u2113 = 2 \u2192 d orbital \u2192 10 electrons\n- 6s\u00b9 \u2192 \u2113 = 0 \u2192 not relevant\n\nNote: The 4d and 3d orbitals are filled earlier in the periodic table, but in gold, the configuration is not [Xe] 4f\u00b9\u2074 5d\u2079 6s\u00b2 due to relativistic effects, but rather 5d\u00b9\u2070 6s\u00b9 \u2014 which is the stable configuration.\n\nSo, the only d electrons are in the 5d orbital: 10 electrons.\n\nAre there any other d electrons? For example, in 4d or 3d? In the configuration of Xe (which is the core), we have:\n- Xe: [Kr] 5s\u00b2 4d\u00b9\u2070 5p\u2076 \u2192 so 4d\u00b9\u2070 is part of the core.\n\nXe has atomic number 54. Its configuration is:\n1s\u00b2 2s\u00b2 2p\u2076 3s\u00b2 3p\u2076 4s\u00b2 3d\u00b9\u2070 4p\u2076 5s\u00b2 4d\u00b9\u2070 5p\u2076\n\nSo in Xe, we have:\n- 3d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 \u2113 = 2 \u2192 d electrons\n- 4d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 \u2113 = 2 \u2192 d electrons\n\nSo total d electrons in the core (Xe) are:\n- 3d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10 electrons\n- 4d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10 electrons\n\nThen in gold (Au), we have:\n- 5d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10 electrons\n\nSo total electrons with \u2113 = 2 (i.e., in d orbitals) are:\n- 3d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10\n- 4d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10\n- 5d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10\n\nTotal = 10 + 10 + 10 = 30 electrons?\n\nWait \u2014 but gold's full configuration includes all electrons. Let's list all d orbitals:\n\n- 3d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10 electrons\n- 4d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10 electrons\n- 5d\u00b9\u2070 \u2192 10 electrons\n\nTotal d electrons = 30\n\nBut is that correct?\n\nYes \u2014 in the periodic table, all d orbitals with \u2113 = 2 are filled in the core (3d, 4d, 5d) up to Xe and beyond.\n\nBut in gold, the configuration is:\n[Xe] 4f\u00b9\u2074 5d\u00b9\u2070 6s\u00b9\n\nSo, the core Xe includes:",

In a large bowl, add the chopped kale and gently massage it with a few tablespoons of the almond butter until the leaves are softened and slightly wilted. This helps break down the fibrous texture and enhances flavor.\n\n2. In a small bowl, whisk together the apple cider vinegar, agave nectar, and tamari to create a tangy glaze.\n\n3. Drizzle the glaze over the kale-almond butter mixture and toss gently to coat evenly.\n\n4. Add the chopped walnuts or almonds and apple slices (if using), and toss again to combine.\n\n5. Serve immediately, or refrigerate for 15\u201320 minutes to let flavors meld.
