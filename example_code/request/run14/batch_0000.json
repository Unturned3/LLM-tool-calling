        "text": "The study involves recruiting sixty children with chronic headaches and assigning them to receive acupuncture as an addition to their usual therapy for a defined period (2 months). All participants receive the same intervention (acupuncture) throughout the study, with no switching between treatments. This is a type of controlled trial where all participants receive the same intervention, and the outcome is assessed over time.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Case-control \u2013 This design compares individuals with a condition (cases) to those without (controls), looking back at exposure history. Not applicable here because the study is not comparing exposure histories.\n\nB. Case series \u2013 This involves describing a group of patients with a similar condition without a control group or comparison. There is no control group or comparison being made here, but the study is not just descriptive\u2014it is evaluating an intervention. So, not the best fit.\n\nC. Crossover \u2013 This design involves participants receiving different treatments in sequence (e.g., treatment A then treatment B), with a washout period. In this study, all children receive acupuncture throughout, so there is no crossover.\n\nD. Cross-sectional \u2013 This design collects data at a single point in time. The study spans 2 months and evaluates outcomes over time, so it is not cross-sectional.\n\nNone of the options perfectly describe the design, but the key feature is that all participants receive the same intervention over time. However, this is not a crossover, case-control, or cross-sectional study.\n\nBut note: the question says \u201cevaluate the feasibility\u201d of acupuncture. Feasibility studies often involve a single intervention group with no control, and they assess whether the intervention can be implemented effectively.\n\nTherefore, this is best described as a **case series** if it's simply a descriptive study of a group receiving a treatment. However, a case series does not involve a comparison or a control group, and it is usually not designed to evaluate intervention efficacy or feasibility in a rigorous way.\n\nBut in research design, a feasibility study involving a small group of patients receiving an intervention (without a control group) is often classified as a **case series** when it is exploratory and descriptive.\n\nThus, the best available option among the choices is:\n\nB. Case series\n\nThe answer is (B)",

        "text": "The patient has sustained a high-energy pelvic trauma with a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and perineal bruising, along with blood at the urethral meatus. This suggests a high risk of urethral injury, particularly in the region most vulnerable to pelvic fractures.\n\nThe urethra has several segments:\n- **Spongy (penile) urethra**: Most common site of injury in blunt pelvic trauma, but it is less vulnerable than the membranous segment.\n- **Membranous urethra**: Located in the pelvic floor, passing through the urogenital diaphragm and the pelvic floor. It is the most vulnerable portion in pelvic trauma due to its narrow passage and position directly over the pubic symphysis and pelvic ring.\n- **Prostatic urethra**: Located in the prostate, less commonly injured in trauma.\n- **Intramural (pre-prostatic) urethra**: Part of the spongy urethra, not the most at-risk.\n\nIn pelvic fractures, especially involving the pubic ramus, the membranous urethra is at the greatest risk because it passes through the pelvic floor and is directly adjacent to the fracture site. Retrograde urethrography is used to evaluate for disruption here.\n\nTherefore, the portion of the urethra at greatest risk in this patient is the membranous urethra.\n\nThe answer is (B)",

There is no other penile trauma. A plain x-ray shows a fracture of the superior pubic ramus and retrograde urethrography is done to evaluate for a urethral disruption.
