        "text": "The study's sample size is reduced from 1000 to 500 patients. Sample size directly affects the statistical power of a study. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (i.e., detecting a true effect when one exists). A smaller sample size decreases the power of the study because it reduces the ability to detect a true effect due to increased variability and reduced precision.\n\nThe alpha level (0.05) and beta level (0.20) are fixed in this scenario. Alpha represents the chance of a type I error (false positive), which is not affected by sample size. Beta represents the chance of a type II error (false negative), and the power (1 - beta) is directly related to sample size. As sample size decreases, power decreases, and so does the ability to detect a true difference \u2014 meaning the chance of a type II error increases.\n\nTherefore, reducing the sample size from 1000 to 500 would most likely increase the chance of a type II error.\n\nOption D (sensitivity) refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify true positives, which is not directly related to study design or sample size in this context and is not typically a measure used in evaluating treatment effectiveness in randomized controlled trials.\n\nCorrect answer: B. Chance of a type II error\n\nThe answer is (B)",

A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?\n Options:\nA. Chance of a type I error\nB.
