        "text": "The patient has a history of poor pain control with codeine, and this is observed in other family members, suggesting a possible inherited metabolic deficiency. Codeine is a prodrug that is metabolized primarily by the enzyme CYP2D6 to morphine, which is the active analgesic component. Individuals who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 (a common genetic variant) will have reduced conversion of codeine to morphine, resulting in inadequate pain relief.\n\nThis phenomenon is well-documented in clinical pharmacology and is especially relevant in patients with a family history of poor response to codeine. Therefore, the most likely explanation for the therapeutic failure is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine.\n\nOption A (decreased absorption) is less likely, as absorption issues would not be family-specific. Option C (deficiency of \u03ba receptors) is not relevant to codeine's mechanism of action, as codeine primarily acts via \u03bc-opioid receptors after conversion to morphine. Option D (increased plasma protein-binding) would not explain poor response, as it typically affects drug distribution rather than efficacy.\n\nThe answer is (B)",

The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?\n Options:\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine\nB. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine\nAnswer:",
