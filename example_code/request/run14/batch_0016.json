        "text": "The organism described\u2014gram-negative diplococci causing recurrent urethritis in a sexually active man\u2014is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This pathogen is known for its ability to evade the host immune response, and one of the key reasons for recurrent infections is its antigenic variation, which allows it to escape immune surveillance by changing surface antigens (such as pili and outer membrane proteins) between infections.\n\nWhile other options like catalase (B) are not relevant (N. gonorrhoeae is catalase-negative), and T- or B-lymphocyte inhibition (C and D) are not typical features of this organism, antigenic variation is a well-documented mechanism by which N. gonorrhoeae causes repeated infections despite prior exposure and immune response.\n\nTherefore, the best explanation for reinfection is antigenic variation.\n\nThe answer is (A)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A sexually active 23-year-old man with multiple sex partners has dysuria and a yellow urethral exudate. Gram stain of the exudate shows numerous neutrophils, many that contain intracellular gram-negative diplococci. He has had three similar episodes of urethritis over the past 2 years. Which of the following properties of the infecting organism best explains the reinfection?\n Options:\nA. Antigenic variation\nB. Catalase\nC. Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function\nD. Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function\nAnswer:",
