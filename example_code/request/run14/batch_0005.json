If breathing is difficult, seek medical attention.  \n- **Skin contact**: Wash with soap and water. No special treatment required.  \n- **Eye contact**: Rinse thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical advice if irritation persists.  \n- **Ingestion**: Do not induce vomiting. Seek medical advice if symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, or dizziness occur.  \n- **Note**: Ingestion of large quantities may require medical evaluation due to electrolyte imbalance risk.  \n\n*Always follow local regulations and consult a safety professional for specific handling protocols.*",
