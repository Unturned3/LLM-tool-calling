        "text": "The patient is a 36-year-old man with new-onset headaches that are morning headaches, relieved by over-the-counter analgesics, and associated with recent significant stress (promotion and relocation). The key finding is blurring of the optic disc margins bilaterally, which is a classic sign of increased intracranial pressure (ICP), particularly in the context of pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension).\n\nGiven the clinical presentation and the presence of optic disc edema, this is strongly suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension, which is more common in young women but can occur in men, especially with significant lifestyle stressors or weight gain.\n\nThe next appropriate step is to confirm the diagnosis, which includes evaluating for elevated ICP. This typically involves measuring opening pressure via lumbar puncture, which is the gold standard. However, in the initial workup, a CT scan of the head (Option B) is often performed to rule out structural causes such as tumors, hemorrhage, or hydrocephalus \u2014 which could be mimicking or causing the symptoms.\n\nHowever, in this case, the patient has no red flags for acute pathology, and the optic disc blurring is a red flag for increased ICP. While CT may be useful, it is not the most specific or definitive test. A lumbar puncture would be more appropriate to assess opening pressure and CSF opening pressure, which is the definitive test for ICP.\n\nBut among the listed options, none mention lumbar puncture. So we must choose the best available option.\n\nOption A: \u03b2-blockers (like timolol) are used in the treatment of pseudotumor cerebri and can be effective, but they are not the first step in diagnosis.\n\nOption B: CT scan of the head \u2014 can rule out structural causes, but in the absence of acute symptoms or red flags, it may not be necessary. Also, CT is not sensitive for detecting increased ICP.\n\nOption C: EEG \u2014 not relevant; this is a seizure-related test, not appropriate here.\n\nOption D: Refer to a neurologist \u2014 this is reasonable given the concerning findings (optic disc edema, headache pattern), especially since pseudotumor cerebri requires specialist evaluation and management.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step in a patient with suspected idiopathic intracranial hypertension and optic disc blurring is to refer for neurologic evaluation to ensure proper diagnosis and management.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

        "text": "The patient is a 47-year-old man who underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) of a femoral fracture four days postoperatively. He presents with agitation, confusion, tremulousness, and disorientation (oriented to person but not place or time), despite treatment with haloperidol. His vital signs show mild hypertension, and the CT head is normal. There is no evidence of focal neurologic deficits or signs of sepsis, and no history of alcohol use or withdrawal.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Adverse effect of medication \u2013 Haloperidol is used for agitation, but the patient is still agitated and uncooperative. While medications can cause confusion, it is unlikely that haloperidol is the cause given the persistent symptoms and lack of improvement. Also, other medications (acetaminophen, atenolol, heparin) are not typically associated with such neurologic changes. This is less likely.\n\nB. Alcohol withdrawal \u2013 There is no history of alcohol use or withdrawal, and no classic signs (tachycardia, diaphoresis, tremors with anxiety). Though tremors can occur, the absence of a history and lack of other withdrawal symptoms make this unlikely.\n\nC. Fat emboli \u2013 This is a well-known complication following long bone fractures (especially femoral fractures), typically occurring within 24\u201372 hours post-injury. It can present with neurological symptoms such as confusion, agitation, and altered mental status, even in the absence of respiratory or hematologic findings. The timing (4 days post-fracture) is slightly beyond the classic window, but fat embolism can present later. The CT head is normal, which is consistent with fat emboli (which may not show on CT), and the neurologic symptoms are classic. Fat emboli are a known cause of post-fracture confusion and are common in femoral fractures.\n\nD. Sepsis \u2013 Sepsis would typically present with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and altered mental status. This patient has no fever (temperature is 37.2\u00b0C), no leukocytosis, no signs of infection, and no other systemic signs. CT head is normal, and no infection is indicated. Sepsis is unlikely.\n\nThe most likely cause of confusion in this post-fracture patient with no focal findings and normal head CT is fat embolism.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
