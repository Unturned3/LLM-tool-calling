        "text": "The question describes a healthy 22-year-old man who consumes an 800-calorie meal and, 12 hours later, still has serum glucose within the reference range. The key point is that despite the meal, glucose levels do not rise significantly and remain normal after 12 hours of fasting.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal \u2014 This is not accurate. After a meal, digestion and absorption occur within 1\u20132 hours. By 12 hours, the meal is fully digested and absorbed, and there is no ongoing absorption of calories. This mechanism does not explain maintenance of normal glucose levels 12 hours post-meal.\n\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle \u2014 Skeletal muscle does not release glucose into the bloodstream under normal conditions. It can take up glucose from the blood, but it does not contribute to glucose release into circulation. This is incorrect.\n\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver \u2014 This is a key mechanism for maintaining blood glucose during fasting or after a meal when glucose is needed. After a meal, blood glucose rises and insulin promotes glycogen synthesis. During the fasting phase (like the 12-hour period), the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose and releases it into the blood to maintain normal serum glucose levels. This is a primary mechanism in healthy individuals.\n\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues \u2014 Leptin is released in response to increased adipose tissue mass and is involved in appetite regulation and energy balance. It does not directly regulate serum glucose concentration. While leptin may influence metabolism, it is not the primary mechanism for maintaining serum glucose levels.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for maintaining normal serum glucose 12 hours after a meal is glycogenolysis in the liver.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
