        "text": "The patient is a kidney transplant recipient with fever, malaise, muscle and joint pain, and a rising serum creatinine. He has a history of transplantation and is on cyclosporine and corticosteroids. The key finding is the presence of intracellular inclusion bodies on biopsy, which is highly suggestive of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection\u2014particularly in the context of immunosuppressed transplant patients.\n\nCMV infection is a common cause of post-transplant complications, and the presence of intracellular inclusions (such as the characteristic \"owl's eye\" appearance) in renal biopsy is a hallmark of CMV. The patient has no signs of bacterial infection, and the inflammatory symptoms are consistent with viral illness. Given that the serum creatinine has risen despite therapeutic cyclosporine levels, and the biopsy shows CMV inclusions, the next step is antiviral therapy.\n\nAmong the options:\n- A. Increasing corticosteroids may worsen immunosuppression and is not indicated here.\n- B. Increasing cyclosporine is not appropriate because the patient already has therapeutic levels and rising creatinine may indicate viral injury, not drug toxicity.\n- C. Amphotericin B is for fungal infections, not CMV.\n- D. Ganciclovir is the first-line antiviral therapy for CMV infection in transplant patients.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is to begin ganciclovir therapy.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n Options:\nA. Increase the dosage of corticosteroids\nB. Increase the dosage of cyclosporine\nC. Begin amphotericin therapy\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\nAnswer:",
