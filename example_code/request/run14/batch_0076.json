The key observation is that quiz performance improved significantly, but tardiness only decreased slightly.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the options:\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.  \n\u2192 This is true in general (e.g., gambling), but the teacher's reward system is not a variable ratio schedule. The quiz reward is fixed-ratio (3 quizzes in a row), not variable. Also, tardiness is not the behavior that's most resistant. So, this doesn't best explain the observation.\n\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.  \n\u2192 This is plausible. The quiz rewards (a sticker after 3 consecutive above-90% performances) are more meaningful or interesting to students, possibly leading to greater motivation. In contrast, showing up on time may be a more routine, less personally motivating behavior. This could explain why quiz performance improved more than punctuality. This option directly addresses the differential response to the two rewards.\n\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.  \n\u2192 Continuous reinforcement is not part of the system. The quiz reward is fixed-ratio, and the tardiness reward is daily (which could be seen as continuous). But the comparison is not accurate \u2014 the teacher didn't use continuous reinforcement for quizzes. Also, the behavior change (quiz performance) is not compared to continuous reinforcement. This is not the best explanation.\n\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.  \n\u2192 There is no variable-interval schedule in the scenario. The quiz reward is fixed-ratio, not variable-interval. So this option is factually incorrect in this context.\n\nBest explanation: B \u2014 the students were more intrinsically motivated to do well on quizzes than to show up on time, which explains the greater improvement in quiz performance.\n\nThe answer is (B)",
