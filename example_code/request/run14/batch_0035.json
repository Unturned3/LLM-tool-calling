        "text": "The energy charge of the cell is defined as the ratio of the concentration of phosphorylated nucleotides (ATP and ADP) to the total adenine nucleotide pool. It reflects the extent to which the adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated, with a high energy charge indicating more ATP and less ADP/AMP, which signifies high cellular energy status.\n\nOption A refers to membrane potential, not energy charge.  \nOption B describes the function of the Na+/K+ ATPase, which maintains ion gradients but does not define energy charge.  \nOption C refers to energy consumption, not energy charge.  \nOption D correctly describes the energy charge as the extent of phosphorylation of the adenine nucleotide pool.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
