        "text": "The patient has a history of frostbite with extensive tissue necrosis (blackened toes), now complicated by cellulitis, fever, and worsening confusion\u2014signs of systemic infection and possible sepsis. The black discoloration indicates necrotic tissue, and the presence of fever and confusion suggests the development of osteomyelitis or septicemia, likely due to bacterial invasion from the necrotic tissue.\n\nIn such cases, the most appropriate management is surgical debridement of necrotic tissue to remove the source of infection and prevent systemic spread. While amputation may be necessary in severe cases, it is not the first-line or most appropriate initial treatment in this scenario. Topical collagenase (option B) is used for specific wound debridement in certain settings (e.g., in wounds with necrotic tissue), but it is not the standard for frostbite-related necrosis with infection. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy may be considered in specific cases of compromised tissue perfusion or infection, but it is not the primary treatment for established necrosis and infection.\n\nDebridement of necrotic skin over the toes (option C) is appropriate to remove infected and dead tissue, improve wound healing, and reduce the risk of systemic infection. However, in frostbite with extensive tissue necrosis and signs of sepsis, the most appropriate treatment may involve surgical debridement of the entire necrotic tissue, potentially including bone (osteomyelitis), which may require more extensive intervention.\n\nBut among the given options, **C** (Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes) is the most appropriate and immediate step in managing infected necrotic tissue in the setting of frostbite complications, especially before considering amputation or hyperbaric oxygen.\n\nNote: In clinical practice, such cases often require surgical debridement, and if the tissue loss is extensive, amputation may be indicated. However, the question asks for the *most appropriate treatment* in this context, and debridement is the first-line intervention before definitive amputation.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet. All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot.
