        "text": "The patient presents with symptoms and findings consistent with heart failure, particularly left-sided heart failure. Key features include:\n\n- Painless bilateral ankle swelling (edema)\n- Dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea (waking up short of breath)\n- Elevated jugular venous pressure (15 cm H2O)\n- Crackles at lung bases (pulmonary congestion)\n- Holosystolic murmur at apex (suggestive of mitral regurgitation)\n- Soft S3 (common in left ventricular dysfunction)\n- 2+ pitting edema\n\nThese findings strongly suggest left ventricular systolic dysfunction, possibly due to systolic heart failure.\n\nWhile options like serum troponin (A) may detect myocardial injury, it does not confirm the diagnosis of heart failure or assess ventricular function. An ECG (B) may show signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia but is not definitive. An exercise stress test (C) is not the best choice in this case, especially without a clear indication of ischemia or for diagnosing heart failure.\n\nEchocardiography (D) is the gold standard for evaluating cardiac structure and function. It can confirm left ventricular ejection fraction, detect valvular abnormalities (e.g., mitral regurgitation), and assess overall cardiac function\u2014thus providing the most direct confirmation of the diagnosis of heart failure.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis is echocardiography.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles.

He has decreased femoral pulses, which suggests reduced peripheral perfusion. His ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, and he has a history of hypertension and heavy smoking.\n\nKey findings:\n- Severe chest pain with diaphoresis suggests acute cardiac or vascular pathology.\n- Diastolic murmur radiating to the right sternal border and decreased femoral pulses are highly suggestive of aortic dissection, especially given the presence of aortic regurgitation or dissection-related flow abnormalities.\n- In aortic dissection, a diastolic murmur may be heard due to turbulent flow in the dissection or aortic valve involvement.\n- Decreased femoral pulses are common in aortic dissection due to compression of the aorta or involvement of the branches.\n- Left ventricular hypertrophy on ECG is commonly seen in hypertension, which is a risk factor for aortic dissection.\n\nAcute myocardial infarction (A) is unlikely because the pain is not described as typical anginal (e.g., radiation to left arm), and the diastolic murmur and peripheral pulse deficit are atypical for MI. Esophageal rupture (C) is rare, painful, and usually presents with severe upper abdominal pain, vomiting, and signs of sepsis, not consistent with this case. Mitral valve prolapse (D) typically presents with a click and sometimes a systolic murmur, not a diastolic blowing murmur with pulse deficits.\n\nThus, the most likely diagnosis is aortic dissection.\n\nThe answer is (B)",
