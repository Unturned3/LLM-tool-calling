Atrial impulses are conducted to the atria but not to the ventricles. The ventricles then generate their own rhythm (usually at a slow rate, often 30\u201350 bpm), which is independent of the atrial rate. This explains the 90/min P-waves and 40/min QRS complexes with no relationship.\n\nCannon a waves occur when atrial contractions occur in the absence of ventricular response, which is a hallmark of complete AV block.\n\nNow, let's evaluate the options:\n\nA. Right bundle branch block \u2014 does not cause dissociation of P and QRS waves; it would show a widened QRS with rSR' pattern, not a dissociated rhythm.\n\nB. Second-degree AV block, type I (Wenckebach) \u2014 shows progressive lengthening of PR interval until a P wave is dropped, with a regular pattern. Does not show complete dissociation.\n\nC. Second-degree AV block, type II \u2014 shows intermittent non-conduction of P waves, but the remaining conduction is regular and usually with a constant PR interval. There is no complete dissociation.\n\nD. Third-degree AV block \u2014 shows complete dissociation between atrial and ventricular rates, with no conduction from atria to ventricles. This matches the clinical findings.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is third-degree AV block.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

He also has had difficulty performing daily tasks because he is easily fatigued. He had a myocardial infarction 12 years ago. His pulse is 40/min, respirations are 18/min, and blood pressure is 138/85 mm Hg. Physical examination shows evidence of cannon a waves. An ECG shows a P-wave rate of 90/min, and an R-wave rate of 40/min, with no apparent relation between the two. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?\n Options:\nA.

While sweating (which involves water loss through the skin) is a key mechanism in thermoregulation, the primary compensatory mechanism in response to heat is not simply increasing water loss, but rather activating sweating to cool the body. However, among the listed options, the most direct physiological response to heat is increased water loss through the skin (via sweating), which helps cool the body.\n\nOption A (decreasing salt retention) is not a primary compensatory mechanism in heat exposure.  \nOption B (increasing respiration rate) may occur, but it's less significant in heat compared to sweating.  \nOption C (increasing heart rate) can occur during heat stress but is not the primary compensatory mechanism.  \nOption D (increasing water lost through skin) directly supports thermoregulation via evaporation.\n\nThe best answer is D.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
