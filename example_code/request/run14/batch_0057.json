        "text": "The patient has sarcoidosis and is on long-term glucocorticoid therapy. His new symptom is leg pain that worsens with weight-bearing, with mild left hip pain on both active and passive motion. He has no neurological deficits, and dorsalis pedis pulses are intact, ruling out peripheral vascular or nerve-related causes. The presence of bilateral basilar crackles suggests ongoing pulmonary involvement, consistent with sarcoidosis.\n\nGlucocorticoids are known to cause significant bone loss, leading to osteoporosis. Osteoporosis increases the risk of fractures and can cause bone pain, especially in weight-bearing joints like the hip. The pain with weight-bearing and hip involvement is consistent with osteoporotic changes, particularly in the femoral head or pelvic bones. Although avascular necrosis (option A) can cause hip pain and is associated with glucocorticoids, it typically presents with acute or subacute pain and may be associated with joint instability or mechanical symptoms. However, in the absence of trauma or a known history of avascular necrosis, and given the chronic nature of the pain and the patient's long-term steroid use, osteoporosis is a more common and likely cause.\n\nHerniated nucleus pulposus (B) typically causes radicular pain, neurologic deficits, or sciatica, which are not present here. Narrowing of the hip joint (C) is not a common or typical diagnosis in this context.\n\nThus, the most likely cause of the patient's symptoms is osteoporosis due to long-term glucocorticoid therapy.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

        "text": "The most appropriate initial method to investigate a thyroid lump, especially when evaluating a benign-appearing, freely movable mass without symptoms such as weight loss, fever, or tenderness, is to determine whether the lesion is solid or cystic and to assess its characteristics. While nuclear thyroid scans (like a radioactive iodine scan) can provide functional information, they are not first-line for evaluating a new thyroid nodule. Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is the gold standard for evaluating the cytologic nature of thyroid nodules, particularly to assess for malignancy. However, before FNA, imaging to evaluate the size, shape, and vascularity of the nodule is typically performed.\n\nUltrasonography is the first-line imaging modality for thyroid nodules because it is non-invasive, widely available, and provides detailed information about the nodule\u2019s size, shape, margins, echogenicity, and presence of microcalcifications\u2014key features in risk stratification. Based on ultrasound findings, decisions about whether to proceed with FNA can be made.\n\nTherefore, while fine-needle aspiration is essential for diagnosis, it is not the initial investigation. The most appropriate initial method is ultrasonography.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
