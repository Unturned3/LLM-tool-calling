This occurs after translation. \u2705\n\nB. **Attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds** \u2013 This describes the process of translation itself, where amino acids are added to the growing polypeptide chain via peptide bonds. This happens **during** translation, not after. Post-translational modifications do **not** involve adding more amino acids through peptide bonds. \u274c\n\nC. **Glycosylation** \u2013 The addition of sugar groups to proteins; a common post-translational modification. \u2705\n\nD. **Phosphorylation** \u2013 Addition of phosphate groups to serine, threonine, or tyrosine residues; a key post-translational modification. \u2705\n\nThus, the process that does **not** occur after translation is the attachment of more amino acids via peptide bonds \u2014 that happens during translation.\n\nThe answer is (B)",

        "text": "The patient presents with shoulder pain, tenderness at the greater tubercle of the humerus, and painful abduction of the upper extremity. These findings are classic for a supraspinatus muscle dysfunction, as the supraspinatus is responsible for initiating abduction of the arm, and its insertion is at the greater tubercle of the humerus. Pain during abduction is a hallmark of supraspinatus pathology, such as tendinopathy or rotator cuff injury.\n\nWhile the other muscles listed (anterior scalene, latissimus dorsi, pectoralis minor) can contribute to shoulder mechanics, their dysfunction is less likely to present with the specific pattern of pain at the greater tubercle and painful abduction.\n\nThe supraspinatus is the most directly involved muscle in this clinical presentation.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
