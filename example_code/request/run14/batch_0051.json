His presence was a steady compass in times of uncertainty. We gather today not to mourn, but to celebrate a life fully lived and deeply loved.  \n\n**Personal Stories**  \nI\u2019ll never forget the morning my daughter came home from school and found her father sitting on the porch, reading a poem aloud to her. He didn\u2019t just read\u2014it was as if he was whispering a secret only they could hear. That moment, filled with warmth and stillness, reminded us all how much he cherished his family. His love wasn\u2019t loud\u2014it was woven into the fabric of everyday moments.  \n\n**Accomplishments**  \nHe was patient, compassionate, resilient, visionary, and humble. With quiet courage, he built bridges between people, inspired communities, and led with integrity. His work in education and mentorship transformed lives, and his unwavering belief in others left a lasting legacy.  \n\n**Conclusion**  \nThough he is no longer with us, his spirit lingers in every smile, every act of kindness, and every heart he touched. May we carry his light forward, one thoughtful choice at a time.  \n\n*\"A good person is not one who never makes a mistake, but one who never stops trying to be better.\"*",

        "text": "The patient is a young, sexually active woman presenting with a tender, fluctuant mass in the labia, consistent with an abscess. The clinical features\u2014moderate-to-severe pain, swelling, fluctuance, and location near the introital opening\u2014suggest a labial abscess, which is commonly caused by a bacterial infection, often due to sexually transmitted infections (STIs) such as chlamydia or gonorrhea, or from poor hygiene or trauma.\n\nHowever, the most appropriate initial management for a tender, fluctuant abscess is surgical drainage, as it directly addresses the source of infection and provides rapid relief. While antibiotics are important in treating the underlying infection, especially if a STI is suspected, the presence of a fluctuant mass indicates that the abscess has formed and requires drainage to resolve the localized infection.\n\nOptions:\n- A (IV metronidazole): may be used if anaerobic infection or STI (like trichomoniasis) is suspected, but not first-line for a fluctuant abscess.\n- B (IV penicillin G): not typically used for labial abscesses; more relevant for syphilis or streptococcal infections.\n- C (ultrasound-guided needle aspiration): may be considered in certain cases, but is not standard for labial abscesses; it carries a higher risk of incomplete drainage and infection spread.\n- D (incision and drainage): is the most appropriate and definitive step in managing a fluctuant abscess.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is incision and drainage.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
