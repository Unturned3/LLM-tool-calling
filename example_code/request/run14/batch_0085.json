        "text": "The absence of a urethral opening in a stillborn infant, especially in the context of oligohydramnios, is a classic sign of renal agenesis or renal hypoplasia. Oligohydramnios leads to a lack of amniotic fluid, which is essential for normal fetal urinary tract development. The lack of urine production results in poor amniotic fluid volume and can cause a condition known as \"oligohydramnios sequence,\" which includes abnormalities of the urinary tract and the development of the lungs.\n\nOne of the most significant complications of renal agenesis or hypoplasia is pulmonary hypoplasia, due to the lack of urine production and thus the lack of distension of the fetal lungs, which normally develop in response to amniotic fluid volume and pulmonary stretch.\n\nTherefore, the most likely additional finding in this stillborn is pulmonary hypoplasia.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
