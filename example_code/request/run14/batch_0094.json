Keep your back straight.\n\n2. **Seated Shoulder Rolls (1 minute)**  \n   Roll shoulders forward in a circular motion for 30 seconds, then reverse. Release tension in the upper back.\n\n3. **Seated Spinal Twist (1 minute)**  \n   Sit with one knee bent and the other leg extended. Twist your upper body to the side, keeping your back straight. Alternate sides.\n\n4. **Seated Leg Extensions (30 seconds)**  \n   Extend one leg out in front, hold for 5 seconds, then return. Repeat on the other leg. Keep your torso stable.\n\n5. **Standing Neck Stretches (30 seconds)**  \n   Gently tilt your head to the right and left, then forward and backward. Hold each for 5 seconds.\n\n6. **Standing Arm Circles (1 minute)**  \n   Extend arms out to the sides and make small circles clockwise for 30 seconds, then reverse.\n\n**Tip:** Perform each movement with controlled motion and breathe deeply. Do this routine every 1\u20132 hours to stay active and reduce stiffness.",
