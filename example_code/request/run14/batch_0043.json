        "text": "The patient presents with signs of androgen excess: hirsutism, clitoral enlargement, increased serum testosterone, and a 12-cm ovarian mass. The serum androstenedione, DHEA, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are normal, which suggests that the androgen production is not coming from adrenal sources. This points to an ovarian tumor that produces androgens.\n\nAmong the options:\n\n- A. Granulosa cell tumor: These typically produce estrogen, leading to endometrial proliferation and symptoms of estrogen excess (e.g., endometrial hyperplasia, breast tenderness), not androgen excess. So, this is unlikely.\n\n- B. Ovarian carcinoid: These are neuroendocrine tumors that typically produce serotonin and cause flushing or diarrhea, not androgens. Not consistent.\n\n- C. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor: These are rare ovarian tumors that produce androgens (testosterone) and are associated with hirsutism, clitoral enlargement, and elevated testosterone. They are the most common cause of ovarian androgen excess. The normal adrenal steroid levels and the presence of hirsutism and clitoral enlargement support this diagnosis.\n\n- D. Teratoma: These are germ cell tumors that can contain various tissues, but they are not typically associated with androgen excess.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is a Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?\n Options:\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\nAnswer:",

        "text": "[Exhibition Catalog: \"Form and Matter \u2013 Five Masters of Sculpture\"]\n\n1. **Auguste Rodin**  \nRodin (1840\u20131917) revolutionized sculpture with expressive bronze and marble. His mastery of texture and movement, as seen in *The Thinker*, breaks classical norms. Through dynamic poses and raw emotional depth, Rodin redefined the human form, emphasizing emotion over idealism.\n\n2. **Henry Moore**  \nMoore (1903\u20131986) pioneered abstract bronze and stone forms. Works like *Reclining Figure* explore organic shapes and negative space. His flowing, humanistic forms reflect a deep understanding of natural forms, blending abstraction with emotional resonance.\n\n3. **Isamu Noguchi**  \nNoguchi (1904\u20131988) fused Japanese aesthetics with modernist sensibility. Using wood, stone, and steel, he created fluid, sculptural landscapes. *The Gate* exemplifies his mastery of balance, light, and material texture, merging nature and artistry in harmonious, meditative forms.\n\n4. **David Smith**  \nSmith (1906\u20131975) excelled in welded steel, crafting dynamic, abstract forms. *Steel Gates* showcases his technical precision and bold, geometric language. His mastery of industrial materials transforms metal into expressive, kinetic sculptures of modernity and tension.\n\n5. **Ai Weiwei**  \nAi Weiwei (b. 1957) uses found objects and modern materials to challenge tradition. *Sunflower Seeds* (2010) comprises 100 million ceramic seeds, blending art and social commentary. His work reflects a fearless engagement with material, form, and political discourse.",
