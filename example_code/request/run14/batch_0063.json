        "text": "The patient has a persistent nonproductive cough lasting 6 weeks, without fever, weight loss, or lung disease. She is on enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, for hypertension. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a dry, nonproductive cough as a side effect due to the accumulation of bradykinin, which stimulates sensory nerves in the airways, leading to cough.\n\nACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, resulting in decreased angiotensin II and increased levels of angiotensin I (which is not further metabolized). However, the key mechanism behind the cough is the accumulation of bradykinin, which is normally broken down by ACE. When ACE is inhibited, bradykinin accumulates and stimulates cough receptors in the airways.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism of her cough is increased serum bradykinin concentrations.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 47-year-old woman comes to the physician because of persistent nonproductive cough for 6 weeks. She has not had fever or weight loss. She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n Options:\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\nAnswer:",

This pattern is consistent with acute urticaria, which is often idiopathic and self-limiting, and typically resolves within weeks without specific treatment.\n\nIn such cases, the most appropriate initial management is symptomatic treatment with antihistamines to relieve itching and hives, as the condition is not caused by a specific allergen or immune abnormality that requires further diagnostic testing or referral.\n\nOptions:\n- A (Determine serum IgE): Not necessary in idiopathic urticaria; IgE is not typically elevated in acute urticaria.\n- B (Determine total eosinophil count): Eosinophilia is not typically seen in acute urticaria and is not a first-line step.\n- C (Refer to an allergist): Not needed in the absence of a clear trigger or persistent symptoms.\n- D (Treat the symptoms): Correct. Symptomatic treatment with antihistamines is the standard of care for acute, self-limited urticaria.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
