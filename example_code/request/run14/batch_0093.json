        "text": "The word *oblique* has its origins in Latin, where it comes from the word *obliquus*, meaning \"slanted\" or \"inclined at an angle.\" The root *ob-* means \"toward\" or \"against,\" and *-liquus* is related to *liquere*, meaning \"to bend\" or \"to turn.\" Together, *obliquus* conveys the idea of something that is bent or tilted in a non-right or non-direct direction.\n\nIn classical Latin, *obliquus* was used to describe a slant or a direction that was not straight or perpendicular. This meaning was carried into medieval and modern Latin, and eventually entered the English language through Latin-based scientific and philosophical terminology.\n\nBy the 16th century, *oblique* was adopted into English with the meaning of \"slanting\" or \"not directly facing.\" Over time, its usage expanded to include figurative meanings\u2014such as \"indirect\" or \"not straightforward\"\u2014especially in legal, political, or moral contexts. For example, an \"oblique reference\" is one that is indirect or hinted at rather than stated directly.\n\nToday, *oblique* is used in both literal and figurative senses. Literally, it describes a direction or angle that is not perpendicular to a surface. Figuratively, it may describe something that is indirect, ambiguous, or evasive.\n\nThe word has remained stable in form and meaning since its early use, reflecting a consistent semantic development from its Latin roots.",
