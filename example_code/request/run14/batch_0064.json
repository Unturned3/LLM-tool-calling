        "text": "The patient is a 37-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal varices who has now vomited bright red blood and is hypotensive (blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg) with tachycardia. This is a classic presentation of massive variceal bleeding, which is a medical emergency. The immediate goal is to stabilize the patient and control the bleeding.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting \u2014 This is a definitive treatment for variceal bleeding, but it is not the immediate management in the emergency setting. It is typically performed after stabilization and in patients who are not candidates for endoscopic therapy.\n\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy \u2014 Vasopressin is a vasopressor that can reduce portal pressure and is used in acute variceal bleeding. It is a reasonable first-line pharmacologic intervention in the emergency setting, especially when endoscopy is not immediately available.\n\nC. Do endotracheal intubation \u2014 This is not indicated unless the patient is at risk for airway compromise, which is not suggested here. The patient is not in respiratory distress.\n\nD. Do upper endoscopy \u2014 This is the **gold standard** for both diagnosis and treatment of variceal bleeding. Endoscopy allows for direct visualization and can be performed immediately to apply band ligation or sclerotherapy to control the bleeding. In patients with active variceal bleeding, endoscopy should be performed as soon as possible after stabilization.\n\nHowever, in the context of massive bleeding and hemodynamic instability, the patient must be stabilized first (e.g., with IV fluids, vasopressors if needed), and then endoscopy should be performed.\n\nAccording to current guidelines (e.g., from the American College of Gastroenterology and American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy), **upper endoscopy is the most appropriate immediate management** in patients with active variceal bleeding, even in the presence of shock, because it allows for definitive treatment. While vasopressin may be used to stabilize the patient temporarily, endoscopy is the definitive intervention.\n\nTherefore, although vasopressin (B) is a reasonable step, **endoscopy (D)** is the most appropriate immediate management.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n Options:\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB.

Six weeks ago, she received a kidney transplant from a living, related donor. Immediately after the operation, she received monoclonal anti-CD3 therapy. Current medications are azathioprine, cyclosporine, and prednisone. Her temperature is 39\u00b0C (102.2\u00b0F). Physical examination shows a well-healed surgical scar. Serum studies show that her urea nitrogen and creatinine concentrations have tripled. A diagnosis of allograft rejection is suspected. In addition, this patient's clinical presentation is best explained by an infection with which of the following agents?\n Options:\nA. Adenovirus\nB. BK virus\nC. Epstein-Barr virus\nD.
