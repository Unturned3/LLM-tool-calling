Substance abuse during adolescence\u2014particularly drugs like alcohol, cocaine, or cannabis\u2014can lead to structural and functional changes in the prefrontal cortex, impairing executive functioning. This supports statement I.\n\nImpaired executive function is closely associated with reduced impulse control, which directly supports statement III.\n\nAuditory hallucinations are more commonly associated with disorders like schizophrenia or severe psychiatric conditions, not typically as a direct result of adolescent substance abuse alone. While substance use can exacerbate psychosis in predisposed individuals, increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations is not a well-established or primary feature of diminished executive function due to substance abuse. Thus, statement II is less likely.\n\nTherefore, the most accurate statements are I and III.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
