        "text": "The patient has a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration, which is consistent with early pressure injury (pressure ulcer) rather than infection. He is quadriplegic due to multiple sclerosis, placing him at high risk for pressure injuries due to immobility and poor skin perfusion.\n\nAmong the options:\n\n- A. Frequent turning: This is a key preventive and therapeutic measure for pressure injuries. It reduces pressure on vulnerable areas, promotes skin perfusion, and helps prevent further breakdown. It is particularly effective in patients with limited mobility, such as this quadriplegic patient.\n\n- B. Use of wet to dry dressings: This is typically used for infected or necrotic wounds, not for early erythema or intact skin. It is not appropriate for a non-infectious, non-breakdown skin lesion.\n\n- C. Whirlpool therapy: This is used for certain types of wounds (e.g., infected or draining wounds), not for early erythema or intact skin.\n\n- D. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy: This is indicated for infection, but the stool test is negative, and there is no sign of infection (no purulent drainage, fever, or systemic signs). The lesion appears to be a pressure-related skin change, not infected.\n\nTherefore, the most effective intervention for this early skin lesion in a bedridden, immobile patient is frequent turning to relieve pressure and prevent progression.\n\nThe answer is (A)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.5\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative. Which of the following is the most effective intervention for this patient's skin lesion?\n Options:\nA. Frequent turning\nB. Use of wet to dry dressings\nC. Whirlpool therapy\nD.
