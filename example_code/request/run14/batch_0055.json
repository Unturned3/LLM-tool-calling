        "text": "The patient presents with a history of excessive daytime sleepiness, snoring, episodes of choking or gasping during sleep, and a significant risk of falling asleep while driving. These symptoms are highly suggestive of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), especially given the obesity (BMI 33), loud snoring, and witnessed apneic events.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea, the gold standard is polysomnography, which monitors multiple physiological parameters during sleep, including brain activity, eye movements, muscle tone, heart rate, respiratory effort, airflow, and blood oxygen levels.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. 24-hour ambulatory ECG monitoring \u2013 useful for detecting arrhythmias or cardiac abnormalities, not for diagnosing sleep apnea.\n\nB. Multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) \u2013 used to assess the severity of hypersomnolence, particularly in narcolepsy, not for diagnosing sleep apnea. It measures sleep onset latency and may show increased sleepiness, but does not confirm apnea.\n\nC. Polysomnography \u2013 the definitive diagnostic test for sleep apnea, as it directly detects apneic events, hypopneas, oxygen desaturation, and sleep architecture.\n\nD. CT scan of the head \u2013 not useful for diagnosing sleep apnea; may be used to evaluate structural brain abnormalities or for other reasons, but not for diagnosing OSA.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate test to confirm the diagnosis is polysomnography.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 52-year-old man comes to the physician with his wife because of a 1-year history of excessive daytime sleepiness. He does not think the symptoms are problematic, but his wife is concerned because he sometimes falls asleep on the sofa early in the evening when guests are present. He also once fell asleep while driving at night and drove off the road, narrowly avoiding injury. His wife says that he has always snored loudly, and over the past year, he has had episodes of choking or gasping for breath while sleeping. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 105 kg (231 lb); BMI is 33 kg/m2 . His pulse is 76/min, respirations are 14/min, and blood pressure is 150/76 mm Hg. Physical and neurologic examinations show no other abnormalities. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n Options:\nA. 24-Hour ambulatory ECG monitoring\nB. Multiple sleep latency test\nC. Polysomnography\nD. CT scan of the head\nAnswer:",
