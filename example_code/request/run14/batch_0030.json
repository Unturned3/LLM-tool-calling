        "text": "The patient is a 16-year-old girl who shared a hotel room with a person diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She has no symptoms and normal vital signs and physical exam findings. Meningococcal disease is a serious infection, but the risk of disease in asymptomatic individuals who have had close contact (such as shared living space) is low. However, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for close contacts of meningococcal disease to prevent infection.\n\nThe standard post-exposure prophylaxis for meningococcal disease in asymptomatic contacts is **rifampin** or **ciprofloxacin**, or **penicillin** in certain cases. However, **rifampin** is the most commonly recommended agent for post-exposure prophylaxis in adolescents and adults, especially when the exposure is recent and the individual is asymptomatic.\n\nIn contrast:\n- A. Administering the meningococcal vaccine is not appropriate as a post-exposure prophylaxis\u2014it is preventive, not for immediate post-exposure.\n- B. Doxycycline is used for treatment of active meningococcal disease, not prophylaxis.\n- C. Penicillin is used for treatment or prophylaxis in certain cases (e.g., in patients with specific risk factors), but it is not the first-line post-exposure prophylaxis for close contacts.\n- D. Rifampin is the recommended post-exposure prophylaxis for asymptomatic contacts of meningococcal disease.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate intervention is to prescribe rifampin.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

But from the first time we sat on the porch with a cold brew and talked about nothing and everything, I knew something special was forming. Alex has this quiet confidence, and he\u2019s always the first one to bring a smile to the room\u2014whether it\u2019s with a joke, a shared memory, or just sitting there, listening.  \n\nAnd then there\u2019s Jamie\u2014my favorite person on the planet. I remember the time we all went to that terrible karaoke night, and Jamie tried to sing 'I Will Always Love You' and ended up with a full-blown wail. We all laughed so hard we cried. That\u2019s Jamie\u2014full of heart, a little bit clumsy, and absolutely fearless. And Alex? He\u2019s the one who always shows up with a backup plan, a kind word, and a genuine desire to understand what makes her happy.  \n\nSo today, as I stand here, I\u2019m not just celebrating two people getting married\u2014I\u2019m celebrating two people who\u2019ve built a life full of laughter, support, and real connection. May your days be filled with adventures, your nights with quiet moments, and your love always strong, steady, and full of joy. Cheers to Alex and Jamie\u2014may your journey together be as beautiful as the memories you\u2019ve already made!\"\n\n---\n\n**Bridesmaid Speech:**\n\n\"Hi everyone! I\u2019m Taylor, and I\u2019ve known Jamie since we were eight years old\u2014back when we both thought we were the only ones who could ride a bike without falling. I remember one summer, we spent the whole day at the lake, building a fort out of old blankets and trying to catch frogs with fishing line. We ended up with a frog in our hair and a soaked dress, but we laughed until we cried.  \n\nAnd Alex? He was always the quiet one\u2014so calm, so thoughtful. I remember the first time I saw him at a school event, and he just smiled at me and said, \u2018I like your scarf.\u2019 That small moment? It changed everything. He didn\u2019t just see me as a friend\u2014he saw the person behind the smile, the dreams, the quiet hopes. And over the years, he\u2019s shown up for every big moment, every small one\u2014whether it was helping me fix my laptop, or just sitting with me when I was nervous about college.  \n\nToday, I\u2019m so incredibly happy to see Jamie and Alex finally together. I know their love isn\u2019t just about grand gestures\u2014it\u2019s about showing up, choosing each other, and building something real. So here\u2019s to a future full of shared dreams, quiet mornings, and even more frog-related chaos. May your love grow stronger with time, and may every day feel like a little adventure. Cheers to Jamie and Alex\u2014here\u2019s to forever!\"",

        "text": "Surfactant is a substance produced by type II alveolar cells in the lungs. Its primary function is to reduce surface tension within the alveoli, which prevents alveolar collapse (atelectasis), especially during expiration. By reducing surface tension, surfactant helps maintain alveoli in an open, expanded state, ensuring that the alveolar-capillary membrane remains intact and functional for efficient gas exchange, including oxygen diffusion.\n\nWhile this indirectly supports oxygen diffusion, the direct role of surfactant in facilitating oxygen diffusion is not by increasing permeability or dilating vessels. Instead, it ensures that alveoli remain open, which is essential for maintaining the surface area and integrity of the gas exchange interface.\n\nTherefore, the best answer is:\n\nB. Maintains alveoli in an open state\n\nThe answer is (B)",

        "text": "Fatty acids are transported into the mitochondria bound to coenzyme A (CoA). Specifically, long-chain fatty acids are first activated to fatty acyl-CoA by the action of acyl-CoA synthetase, and then transported across the inner mitochondrial membrane via the carnitine shuttle. However, the fatty acid itself is transported in the form of fatty acyl-carnitine, which is then converted back to fatty acyl-CoA inside the mitochondrial matrix. But the question asks what fatty acids are transported *bound to* into the mitochondria \u2014 the key point is that the active form of fatty acids inside the mitochondria is fatty acyl-CoA.\n\nWhile carnitine is involved in the transport process, the fatty acid is not transported directly bound to carnitine in the final form. It is bound to CoA during activation and remains as acyl-CoA in the mitochondrial matrix. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\nB. coenzyme A (CoA).\n\nThe answer is (B)",
