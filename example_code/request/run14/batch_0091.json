        "text": "The patient is a 25-year-old man who developed acute chest pain and shortness of breath after snorting cocaine. His symptoms include radiating pain to the left arm, diaphoresis, hypertension (BP 200/100 mm Hg), tachycardia (HR 110), and a normal ECG (no ST changes or T-wave abnormalities). This clinical picture is highly suggestive of cocaine-induced acute coronary syndrome (ACS), specifically acute coronary syndrome due to cocaine use, which can cause coronary vasospasm and myocardial ischemia.\n\nAlthough the ECG is normal, cocaine use is a potent cause of coronary vasospasm and can lead to myocardial ischemia without ST elevation. The patient has not responded to aspirin and nitroglycerin, and the pain persists. The current treatment includes aspirin and IV nitroglycerin (which may be helpful in vasospasm), and lorazepam for anxiety.\n\nNow, the question is: what is the most appropriate *additional* pharmacotherapy?\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Carvedilol \u2014 a beta-blocker with alpha-blocking properties. It is used in hypertension and heart failure, and it has some benefit in vasospasm and reducing myocardial oxygen demand. However, it may be contraindicated in acute cocaine-induced ischemia due to the risk of worsening hypotension or precipitating vasodilation in a setting of uncontrolled hypertension. Also, it can worsen ischemia by reducing cardiac output.\n\nB. Furosemide \u2014 a loop diuretic. This is used for fluid overload, but the patient has no signs of pulmonary edema, and there is no volume overload. No indication for diuresis.\n\nC. Metoprolol \u2014 a beta-blocker. Beta-blockers are generally contraindicated in acute cocaine-induced chest pain because cocaine causes sympathetic overactivity, and beta-blockers can worsen hypotension, bradycardia, or even precipitate cardiac arrest. In fact, beta-blockers are generally avoided in acute cocaine intoxication due to the risk of precipitating cardiovascular collapse.\n\nD. Phentolamine \u2014 a non-selective alpha-adrenergic blocker. Cocaine causes vasoconstriction via alpha-adrenergic stimulation. Phentolamine blocks alpha-receptors and can reverse cocaine-induced vasoconstriction and hypertension. It is used in acute cocaine-induced hypertension and can help relieve ischemia by reversing vasospasm. It is particularly useful in cases where there is no ST elevation but significant ischemia due to vasospasm.\n\nThus, in a patient with cocaine-induced chest pain and hypertension with no ECG changes, the most appropriate additional therapy is phentolamine to reverse alpha-adrenergic stimulation and vasospasm.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 25-year-old man comes to the emergency department because he developed chest pain and shortness of breath 1 hour ago, shortly after snorting cocaine for the first time. He rates the chest pain as a 7 on a 10-point scale and notes that the pain is radiating down his left arm. Medical history is unremarkable and the patient takes no medications or any other illicit drugs. He is 178 cm (5 ft 10 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 22 kg/m2 . The patient is diaphoretic. Vital signs are temperature 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 16/min, and blood pressure 200/100 mm Hg. Pulse oximetry on room air shows an oxygen saturation of 95%. Pupils are equal, round, and reactive to light and accommodation. Lungs are clear to auscultation and percussion. Auscultation of the heart discloses an audible S1 and S2. There is no edema, cyanosis, or clubbing of the digits. The patient is fully oriented. He is treated with supplemental oxygen, a 325-mg aspirin tablet, and intravenous nitroglycerin and lorazepam. Despite therapy, he continues to have chest pain and shortness of breath. ECG shows sinus tachycardia with no ST-segment or T-wave abnormalities. Which of the following is the most appropriate additional pharmacotherapy to initiate at this time?\n Options:\nA. Carvedilol\nB. Furosemide\nC. Metoprolol\nD. Phentolamine\nAnswer:",

        "text": "The question assumes that the circulatory system obeys Bernoulli\u2019s principle, but in reality, blood pressure in the body is primarily determined by cardiac output, vascular resistance, and the effects of gravity and hydrostatic pressure, not by Bernoulli\u2019s principle in the way it applies to ideal fluids in open channels.\n\nHowever, in a simplified fluid dynamics context, Bernoulli\u2019s principle states that in a steady, incompressible, non-viscous flow, an increase in velocity corresponds to a decrease in pressure. But in the human circulatory system, blood flow is not governed by Bernoulli\u2019s principle in a direct or meaningful way due to the high viscosity, pulsatile flow, and the presence of resistance and compliance in vessels.\n\nMoreover, the pressure in the neck and the knee are not at the same height, and gravity contributes to hydrostatic pressure differences. Since the knee is lower than the neck, the hydrostatic pressure (pressure head) due to gravity would be greater in the knee than in the neck. However, in reality, blood pressure in the legs is typically lower than in the neck due to the effects of gravity and venous return, but this is due to physiological mechanisms (like venous valves, skeletal muscle pump) and not directly Bernoulli dynamics.\n\nBut crucially, Bernoulli\u2019s principle does not apply directly to blood flow in arteries and capillaries due to the pulsatile, viscous, and non-ideal nature of blood flow.\n\nTherefore, the best answer among the options \u2014 considering that Bernoulli\u2019s principle is being hypothetically applied \u2014 is that **the pressure in the knee would be higher than in the neck due to the hydrostatic pressure head**, because the knee is lower in the body.\n\nThus, option C: \"The pressure in the knee is greater than the pressure in the neck because of the increase in pressure head\" \u2014 is the most accurate under the assumption of hydrostatic pressure (a component of Bernoulli's principle in fluid systems).\n\nNote: This is a theoretical interpretation based on the assumption that Bernoulli\u2019s principle applies, but in reality, blood pressure is not governed by this principle directly.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
