        "text": "The rate-limiting enzyme of glycolysis is phosphofructokinase (PFK). It catalyzes the committed step of glycolysis, converting fructose-6-phosphate to fructose-1,6-bisphosphate. This step is tightly regulated and controls the flux through the glycolytic pathway.\n\nWhile hexokinase (B) is involved in the first step of glycolysis, it is not the rate-limiting enzyme under most physiological conditions. Phosphorylase (A) is involved in glycogen breakdown, not glycolysis. Pyruvate dehydrogenase (C) is involved in the transition from glycolysis to the Krebs cycle, not in glycolysis itself.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is D.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

I know that multiprocessing gets around the Global Interpreter Lock, but what other advantages are there, and can threading not do the same thing?\nQuestion2: I am learning how to use the threading and the multiprocessing modules in Python to run certain operations in parallel and speed up my code.\nI am finding this hard (maybe because I don't have any theoretical background about it) to understand what the difference is between a threading.Thread() object and a multiprocessing.Process() one.\nAlso, it is not entirely clear to me how to instantiate a queue of jobs and having only 4 (for example) of them running in parallel, while the other wait for resources to free before being executed.\nI find the examples in the documentation clear, but not very exhaustive; as soon as I try to complicate things a bit, I receive a lot of weird errors (like a method that can't be pickled, and so on).\nSo, when should I use the threading and multiprocessing modules?\nCan you link me to some resources that explain the concepts behind these two modules and how to use them properly for complex tasks?\nGeneration:",
