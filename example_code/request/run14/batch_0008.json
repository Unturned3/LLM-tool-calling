        "text": "The patient presents with urinary frequency and incontinence that occur specifically before and after air travel, with symptoms resolving after arrival. The symptoms are temporally linked to travel and anxiety, and are not explained by infection, structural abnormalities, or other medical conditions. The association with anxiety and the pattern of symptoms strongly suggest a psychogenic cause\u2014specifically, stress-induced urinary incontinence (also known as stress urinary incontinence related to anxiety or psychogenic urinary symptoms). \n\nThe fact that symptoms occur before travel and resolve after arrival, along with the patient's reported anxiety and panic, points to a stress-induced or anxiety-related mechanism. This is a classic presentation for anxiety-related urinary symptoms, particularly in young, otherwise healthy individuals with no organic cause.\n\nOption A: Recommend behavioral therapy \u2014 This is appropriate because behavioral therapy (such as bladder retraining, pelvic floor exercises, or cognitive-behavioral therapy) is effective in managing stress-related urinary symptoms and anxiety. It addresses both the behavioral and psychological components.\n\nOption B: Psychoanalytic psychotherapy \u2014 This is not typically first-line for acute or situational symptoms like this, especially in a young adult with clear situational triggers. It is more suited for chronic, complex psychological issues.\n\nOption C: Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities \u2014 This is not practical or evidence-based. Avoiding stress is not a therapeutic strategy and may increase anxiety by promoting avoidance behaviors.\n\nOption D: Review the patient's sexual history \u2014 There is no indication of sexual dysfunction or related issues. This is irrelevant to the current presentation.\n\nThe most appropriate next step is to address the psychological component with a structured, evidence-based behavioral intervention.\n\nThe answer is (A)",

She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n Options:\nA. Recommend behavioral therapy\nB. Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy\nC.

        "text": "The lesions described\u2014recurrent, widespread blisters in flexural areas (axillae and groin), non-breakable, without oral involvement\u2014are classic for pemphigus foliaceus or, more specifically, in this context, likely related to a blistering disorder involving adhesion failure between epidermal cells.\n\nHowever, the key point is the question asks about \"adhesion failure involving which of the following?\" In skin biology, the adhesion between keratinocytes is primarily mediated by desmosomes, which anchor adjacent keratinocytes to each other. These desmosomes are located in the epidermis and are anchored to the basement membrane via intermediate filaments.\n\nIn pemphigus foliaceus, autoantibodies target desmoglein 3, a desmosomal protein, leading to loss of adhesion between keratinocytes and resulting in superficial blistering. The basement membrane itself is not the site of adhesion failure; rather, it is the intercellular adhesion between keratinocytes that fails.\n\nThus, the adhesion failure occurs at the level of the epidermal cells, specifically involving the desmosomes. Among the listed options:\n\n- A. Basement membrane: This is the interface between epidermis and dermis; adhesion failure here would lead to more severe or different blistering (e.g., in bullous pemphigoid), not the typical flexural blistering seen in pemphigus foliaceus.\n- B. Dermal papillae: These are dermal structures involved in dermal-epidermal interaction, not cell-to-cell adhesion.\n- C. Langerhans cells: These are antigen-presenting cells in the epidermis, not involved in adhesion.\n- D. Melanocytes: Involved in pigment production, not adhesion.\n\nTherefore, although the basement membrane is adjacent, the actual adhesion failure is between epidermal cells, which is not directly listed. But among the options, the only one related to structural adhesion in the epidermis is the basement membrane's role in anchoring, but the failure is not in the basement membrane itself.\n\nWait \u2014 correction: the question says \"adhesion failure involving which of the following?\" and the correct physiological site of adhesion failure in blistering diseases like pemphigus foliaceus is the **desmosomes**, which are not listed.\n\nBut among the listed choices, the **basement membrane** is the most structurally relevant to the integrity of the skin layers. However, in pemphigus foliaceus, the failure is in **cell-to-cell adhesion (desmosomal)**, not basement membrane adhesion.\n\nIn bullous pemphigoid, which involves the basement membrane, there is autoantibody to BP180/BP230, leading to blistering due to basement membrane adhesion failure. But the question describes **flexural blisters that do not break easily** \u2014 this is more consistent with **pemphigus foliaceus**, which causes superficial, non-blistering in the early stages, but blisters that do not break easily and are in flexural areas.\n\nActually, pemphigus foliaceus blisters are superficial and often rupture easily \u2014 but the question says \"do not break easily\" \u2014 this is more suggestive of **bullous pemphigoid**, which involves basement membrane zone.\n\nIn bullous pemphigoid, blistering occurs due to autoantibodies against **basement membrane zone proteins (BP180/BP230)**, leading to loss of adhesion between epidermis and dermis. The blisters are tense and do not break easily \u2014 this",
