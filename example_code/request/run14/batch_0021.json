        "text": "David is described as a perfectionist who compares himself to better players and is very hard on himself when he cannot master a section of a piece. This suggests that he has high standards and may struggle with self-worth when outcomes are not met.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\n- Self-efficacy refers to one\u2019s belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations. David is striving to master difficult pieces and is pushing himself, which suggests he believes in his ability to improve \u2014 thus, **strong self-efficacy**.\n\n- Self-esteem is one's overall sense of self-worth. Since David is hard on himself when he fails and constantly compares himself to others, this indicates **low self-esteem**.\n\n- Locus of control refers to whether people believe events are caused by internal factors (internal) or external ones (external). David is blaming himself when he fails, which shows he believes outcomes are due to his own actions \u2014 thus, an **internal locus of control**.\n\nTherefore, the best description is:\n- Low self-esteem\n- Strong self-efficacy\n- Internal locus of control\n\nThis matches option **A**.\n\nThe answer is (A)",
