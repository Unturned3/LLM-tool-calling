Schr\u00f6dinger Equation**\n\n- The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is the fundamental equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time.  \n- It is a partial differential equation that determines the time-dependent wave function, $ \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) $, which encodes all information about a quantum system.  \n- The time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is:\n\n  $$\n  i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\hat{H} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n  $$\n\n  where $ \\hbar $ is the reduced Planck constant, $ \\hat{H} $ is the Hamiltonian operator, and $ \\psi $ is the wave function.\n\n- For a particle in a potential $ V(\\mathbf{r}) $, the Hamiltonian is:\n\n  $$\n  \\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r})\n  $$\n\n- The time-independent version applies to stationary states and is:\n\n  $$\n  \\hat{H} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n  $$\n\n  This is an eigenvalue equation where $ E $ is the energy of the state.\n\n- Solutions to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation yield quantized energy levels and wave functions that describe probabilities of finding a particle in certain regions.\n\n---\n\n**2. Dirac Equation**\n\n- The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by Paul Dirac in 1928 to describe spin-1/2 particles (e.g., electrons) in a way consistent with both quantum mechanics and special relativity.  \n- It naturally incorporates spin and predicts the existence of antimatter.  \n- The Dirac equation is:\n\n  $$\n  \\left( i\\hbar \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - mc \\right) \\psi = 0\n  $$\n\n  where $ \\gamma^\\mu $ are the Dirac gamma matrices, $ \\partial_\\mu $ is the partial derivative, $ m $ is the particle mass, $ c $ is the speed of light, and $ \\psi $ is a four-component spinor wave function.\n\n- The equation ensures that the energy of a particle is bounded from below and leads to negative energy solutions, which were interpreted as antiparticles.  \n- The spinor structure of the solution accounts for intrinsic angular momentum (spin) and allows for the description of electron spin in magnetic fields via the spin-orbit coupling term.  \n- It is the foundation of relativistic quantum field theory and leads to predictions such as the electron\u2019s magnetic moment and fine structure.\n\n--- \n\n*Note: The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is non-relativistic and applies to low-energy systems; the Dirac equation extends quantum mechanics to relativistic regimes and is essential for understanding particles with spin-1/2.*",
