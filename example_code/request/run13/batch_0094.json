Relieves stiffness in the back.\n\n3. **Neck Rolls** (15 seconds)  \n   Gently roll your head in a circular motion (forward and backward) to reduce neck tension.\n\n4. **Shoulder Rolls** (15 seconds each direction)  \n   Roll shoulders forward and backward to release upper back tension.\n\n5. **Standing Forward Bend** (20 seconds)  \n   Stand, hinge at hips, and reach toward toes. Stretch the hamstrings and lower back.\n\n6. **Standing Arm Raises** (20 seconds)  \n   Stand, raise arms overhead, then lower slowly. Activates shoulders and arms.\n\nRepeat the routine 2\u20133 times throughout the day for a refreshing, energizing boost.",
