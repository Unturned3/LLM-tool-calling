        "text": "The organism described\u2014gram-negative diplococci causing recurrent urethritis in a sexually active man\u2014is Neisseria gonorrhoeae. This organism is known for its ability to evade the host immune response and cause repeated infections, especially in individuals with multiple sexual partners.\n\nAmong the options:\n\nA. Antigenic variation \u2013 This is a property of organisms like Haemophilus influenzae or certain strains of influenza virus, where surface antigens change to escape immunity. However, Neisseria gonorrhoeae does not exhibit significant antigenic variation in the same way as, for example, the influenza virus. While some antigenic variation in outer membrane proteins has been observed, it is not the primary reason for reinfection.\n\nB. Catalase \u2013 Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, helping bacteria resist oxidative stress. However, Neisseria gonorrhoeae does not produce catalase, and this property is not relevant to reinfection.\n\nC. Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function \u2013 This is not a known property of N. gonorrhoeae.\n\nD. Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function \u2013 Again, not a known mechanism of N. gonorrhoeae.\n\nHowever, despite the lack of classic antigenic variation, the key reason for recurrent infection in this patient is the organism\u2019s ability to persist and evade immune clearance due to **lack of a robust humoral immune response** and **short-lived immunity** after infection. But among the listed choices, the best explanation for reinfection in the context of repeated episodes is **not clearly supported by standard pathophysiology**.\n\nBut crucially, **Neisseria gonorrhoeae** does not have antigenic variation in the classical sense (like in pneumococcus or influenza), and reinfection is primarily due to **lack of long-term immunity** and **high transmission rates** in sexually active individuals.\n\nHowever, **option A (Antigenic variation)** is the most plausible among the choices when considering immune evasion \u2014 even if not fully accurate for gonococci \u2014 because some studies have shown that gonococci can undergo minor antigenic changes in surface proteins (e.g., Opa proteins), contributing to immune escape.\n\nTherefore, despite some debate, **A** is the best available choice among the listed options.\n\nThe answer is (A)",
