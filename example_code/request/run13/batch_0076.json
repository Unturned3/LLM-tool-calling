The key observation is that quiz performance increased significantly, but tardiness only decreased slightly.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze the options:\n\nA. Variable ratio schedules create the strongest responses and behavior that is the least susceptible to extinction.  \n\u2192 This is true in general (e.g., gambling, reinforcement in addiction), but the teacher is using fixed-ratio schedules (not variable), so this doesn't explain the specific pattern.\n\nB. The students had more intrinsic motivation to do well on quizzes than to show up on time.  \n\u2192 This is plausible. The behavior change (quiz performance) is strong, but tardiness is weak. This suggests that the students were more motivated by the quiz rewards (possibly because they see the academic value) than by the daily sticker. This explains why quiz performance improved more than punctuality. This choice directly accounts for the differential behavior change.\n\nC. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a continuous reinforcement schedule.  \n\u2192 This is not accurate. Fixed-ratio schedules are not compared to continuous reinforcement here. Also, continuous reinforcement would lead to rapid extinction, which isn\u2019t the case. Moreover, the teacher is using fixed-ratio (daily and weekly), not comparing two types of schedules.\n\nD. The students\u2019 behavior change was stronger in response to a fixed-ratio schedule than it was to a variable-interval schedule.  \n\u2192 There is no mention of variable-interval schedules (e.g., random rewards). The teacher\u2019s system is fixed-ratio, so this comparison is not supported.\n\nThe best explanation is that students were more intrinsically motivated to perform well on quizzes than to show up on time \u2014 thus, the academic performance improved more significantly.\n\nThe answer is (B)",
