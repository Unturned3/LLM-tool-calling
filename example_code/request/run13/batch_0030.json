        "text": "The patient is a 16-year-old girl who shared a hotel room with a person diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She has no symptoms and normal vital signs and physical exam. Meningococcal disease is a serious infection that can be transmitted via close contact, especially in enclosed settings like dorms or hotels. However, because she is asymptomatic and has not developed any signs of infection, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is indicated to prevent disease.\n\nFor post-exposure prophylaxis in individuals exposed to meningococcal disease, the standard recommendations from the CDC are:\n\n- For close contacts (e.g., shared living space, household, or direct contact with an infected person), **rifampin** is recommended as a prophylactic agent.\n- Rifampin is effective in preventing meningococcal disease in asymptomatic contacts.\n- Doxycycline and penicillin are not first-line for post-exposure prophylaxis in this setting.\n- Meningococcal vaccine (option A) is not appropriate as a post-exposure prophylactic\u2014it is preventive for unexposed individuals and takes time to become effective; it is not used immediately after exposure.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate intervention for an asymptomatic exposed individual is **rifampin**.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

From our days of building sandcastles at the beach to surviving late-night pizza runs at 2 a.m., Jake has always been the kind of guy who makes you laugh even when you\u2019re stressed.  \n\nBut what truly stands out to me is how he\u2019s grown\u2014how he\u2019s become not just a great partner, but a true friend to everyone around him. And now, with Sarah by his side, I see a different kind of magic. Sarah? She\u2019s the one who once convinced Jake to go to a pottery class just to \u201ctry something new.\u201d He didn\u2019t think he\u2019d survive the wheel, but he did\u2014and now he has a beautiful mug he uses every morning.  \n\nI remember Sarah saying, \u201cLove isn\u2019t just about the big moments\u2014it\u2019s about showing up, even when it\u2019s messy.\u201d And that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019ve seen in Jake and Sarah. From their first date at that tiny coffee shop where they shared terrible chocolate croissants, to the way they still fight about who gets the last slice of pie\u2014this is real love.  \n\nSo, to Jake and Sarah\u2014may your home always be filled with laughter, your days with warmth, and your future with endless adventures. I\u2019m so happy to see you both finally together. Cheers to a lifetime of joy!  \n\n---\n\n**Bridesmaid Speech:**\n\nHello, everyone!  \n\nMy name is Maya, and I\u2019ve known Sarah since we were both 12 and got stuck in the school library trying to find the same book on baking. We\u2019ve shared so many memories\u2014late-night talks about dreams, camping trips under stars, and even that time we tried to make a cake for a school bake sale and ended up with a 3-foot-tall disaster.  \n\nBut what I\u2019ve learned about Sarah over the years is that she\u2019s not just kind and funny\u2014she\u2019s deeply thoughtful. And when she met Jake, I saw something special. The way he listened to her talk about her childhood, how he gently corrected her when she mispronounced a word from a foreign language book\u2014those small gestures told me this was more than just a romance. This was a partnership built on respect and shared values.  \n\nI still remember the day Jake brought Sarah a handmade card with a sketch of a tree and a note that said, \u201cI see you. I love you.\u201d That moment hit me hard. It wasn\u2019t flashy\u2014it was honest. And I know that\u2019s what will carry them through life\u2019s challenges.  \n\nSo to Sarah and Jake\u2014may your love grow deeper with every season, may your home always feel like a safe place to be, and may you keep finding joy in the little things\u2014like good coffee, shared silence, and a well-timed joke. Here\u2019s to a beautiful, lasting journey together. Cheers!",

        "text": "Surfactant is a substance produced by type II alveolar cells in the lungs that reduces surface tension within the alveoli. Without adequate surfactant, alveoli tend to collapse due to high surface tension, especially in premature infants. This collapse reduces the surface area available for gas exchange, impairing oxygen diffusion. Therefore, surfactant's primary role is to prevent alveolar collapse by lowering surface tension, which helps maintain alveoli in an open state.\n\nOption A (Increases surface permeability) is incorrect because surfactant does not increase permeability; it reduces surface tension to prevent collapse.\n\nOption B (Maintains alveoli in an open state) is correct \u2014 this is the primary physiological role of surfactant.\n\nOption C (Depresses cilia of the lung) is incorrect \u2014 surfactant does not affect cilia function.\n\nOption D (Dilates blood vessels) is incorrect \u2014 this is not a role of surfactant.\n\nThe answer is (B)",

        "text": "To determine which substance releases the most energy when completely oxidized, we compare the energy yields per gram of each option:\n\n- **Glucose (A)**: Approximately 16 kJ/g (4 kcal/g). Glucose is a common carbohydrate and is efficiently metabolized via glycolysis and the Krebs cycle.\n\n- **Palmitic acid (B)**: A 16-carbon saturated fatty acid. It yields about 37 kJ/g (9 kcal/g) when fully oxidized. Fatty acids produce more energy per gram than carbohydrates because they are more reduced and contain more carbon-hydrogen bonds, which release more energy during beta-oxidation and subsequent oxidation.\n\n- **Leucine (C)**: An essential amino acid. It yields about 15 kJ/g (4 kcal/g), similar to glucose. Amino acids have lower energy yields due to their nitrogen content, which must be processed and excreted.\n\n- **Alcohol (D)**: Ethanol, when oxidized, yields about 29 kJ/g (7 kcal/g). It is less efficient than fatty acids and is metabolized primarily in the liver via alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, producing less energy due to incomplete oxidation and metabolic inefficiency.\n\nTherefore, **palmitic acid** releases the most energy per gram when completely oxidized.\n\nThe answer is (B)",
