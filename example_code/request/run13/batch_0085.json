        "text": "The absence of a urethral opening in a stillborn fetus, especially in the context of oligohydramnios, is a key clue. Oligohydramnios is often associated with impaired fetal urinary tract development, and the absence of a urethral opening suggests a failure of urethral formation. This is commonly seen in conditions involving the renal system, particularly in cases of renal agenesis or severe renal dysplasia, which are associated with **pulmonary hypoplasia** due to the lack of amniotic fluid.\n\nAmniotic fluid is produced primarily by fetal urine. In the absence of fetal urine (due to renal failure or agenesis), oligohydramnios develops, leading to poor lung development (pulmonary hypoplasia) because the lungs require the mechanical expansion and fluid environment provided by amniotic fluid for normal development.\n\nThus, the most likely additional finding is **pulmonary hypoplasia**.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
