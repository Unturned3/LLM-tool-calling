        "text": "The word *oblique* originates from the Latin word *obliquus*, which means \"slanted\" or \"tilted.\" This root comes from *ob-* (\"toward\" or \"against\") and *-liquus* (\"slanting\" or \"inclined\"). The Latin *obliquus* was used to describe something that is not straight or perpendicular, such as a slanted line or a direction that is not directly forward or backward.\n\nThe term entered Middle English in the 14th century, initially used in geometric or directional contexts to describe lines or angles that are not straight or perpendicular. Over time, its meaning expanded to include figurative uses, such as \"not direct or straightforward,\" \"indirect,\" or \"unconventional.\"\n\nBy the 16th century, *oblique* was used in both literal and metaphorical senses. In modern English, it retains its geometric meaning (a line that is not parallel to a given line or not at a right angle) and has developed a broader usage in contexts like \"oblique remarks\" (indirect or suggestive statements) or \"oblique approaches\" (unstraightforward methods).\n\nThus, the history of *oblique* reflects a linguistic evolution from a precise geometric term to a versatile word that conveys indirectness, slant, or deviation\u2014both physically and figuratively.",
