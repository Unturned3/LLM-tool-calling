        "text": "The patient is experiencing poor pain control with codeine, and there is a family history of poor response to codeine. Codeine is a prodrug that is metabolized primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6 into morphine, which is responsible for its analgesic effects. Individuals who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 (due to genetic polymorphisms) produce little to no morphine from codeine and thus experience poor pain relief.\n\nThe family history of poor pain control with codeine strongly suggests a hereditary deficiency in the metabolism of codeine to morphine. This is a well-documented phenomenon in pharmacogenetics.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine \u2014 Unlikely, as codeine is well absorbed orally and this would not explain a family history.\n\nB. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine \u2014 This directly corresponds to CYP2D6 poor metabolism, which is a known cause of poor response to codeine and is consistent with the family history.\n\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors \u2014 \u03ba-opioid receptors are involved in some pain modulation, but codeine's primary effect is mediated via \u03bc-opioid receptors, and deficiency of \u03ba receptors is not associated with poor response to codeine.\n\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine \u2014 This would affect distribution but not specifically explain poor analgesic effect or family history.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine due to genetic deficiency in CYP2D6.\n\nThe answer is (B)",
