Schr\u00f6dinger Equation**\n\n- The Schr\u00f6dinger equation is the fundamental equation of non-relativistic quantum mechanics, describing how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time.  \n- It is a linear partial differential equation that governs the time-dependent behavior of a wave function, $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$, which encodes all information about a quantum system.  \n- The time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation is given by:  \n  $$\n  i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)}{\\partial t} = \\hat{H} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n  $$  \n  where $\\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, $\\hat{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operator (representing total energy), and $\\psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)$ is the wave function.  \n- For a free particle, the Hamiltonian is $\\hat{H} = -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2$, leading to the time-independent form:  \n  $$\n  \\left( -\\frac{\\hbar^2}{2m} \\nabla^2 + V(\\mathbf{r}) \\right) \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n  $$  \n  known as the time-independent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, where $V(\\mathbf{r})$ is the potential energy and $E$ is the energy eigenvalue.  \n- The solutions to this equation provide quantized energy levels and probability distributions of particles in bound states (e.g., electron in an atom).\n\n---\n\n**2. Dirac Equation**\n\n- The Dirac equation is a relativistic wave equation derived by Paul Dirac in 1928 to describe spin-1/2 particles (e.g., electrons) in a way consistent with both quantum mechanics and special relativity.  \n- It naturally incorporates the concept of spin and predicts the existence of antimatter (e.g., positrons).  \n- The Dirac equation is given by:  \n  $$\n  \\left( i\\hbar \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - mc \\right) \\psi = 0\n  $$  \n  where $\\psi$ is a four-component spinor field, $\\gamma^\\mu$ are the Dirac gamma matrices (satisfying $\\{\\gamma^\\mu, \\gamma^\\nu\\} = 2g^{\\mu\\nu}$), $\\partial_\\mu$ is the partial derivative, $m$ is the particle mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.  \n- The equation ensures that the energy spectrum is bounded from below and predicts negative energy states, which are interpreted as antiparticles.  \n- The Dirac equation reduces to the Klein-Gordon equation for massless particles and to the non-relativistic Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the limit $v \\ll c$.  \n- It forms the foundation of relativistic quantum field theory and is essential for describing electrons, positrons, and other fermions in high-energy physics.",
