        "text": "Yes, children can watch *The Dark Knight* (2008) with parental guidance, but it is not recommended for very young children.\n\nReason: The movie contains intense scenes of violence, crime, and mature themes such as corruption, chaos, and moral ambiguity. There are moments of graphic action, including a high-stakes fight scene involving a bat-shaped object and a deadly confrontation. Additionally, the film includes strong language and complex themes that may be difficult for younger viewers to understand or process.\n\nWhile the film is not explicitly rated as inappropriate for children, its tone and content make it more suitable for teens and older audiences. Parents should consider the child's maturity level before allowing them to watch.",
