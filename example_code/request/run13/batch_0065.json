        "text": "The patient is a 42-year-old man who recently underwent cadaveric renal transplantation and is now presenting with fever, malaise, muscle and joint pain, and elevated serum creatinine (from 0.8 to 1.6 mg/dL). His leukocyte count is low (2700/mm\u00b3), which is within normal range or slightly low, and his cyclosporine level is in the therapeutic range. The key finding is the presence of **intracellular inclusion bodies** on kidney biopsy.\n\nIn the context of transplant patients, especially those on immunosuppressive therapy like cyclosporine and corticosteroids, the presence of intracellular inclusion bodies is highly suggestive of **cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection**, which is a common cause of post-transplant complications. CMV infection can present with fever, leukopenia, and renal dysfunction, and histologically, it shows characteristic intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (e.g., \"owl's eye\" appearance).\n\nGiven that the patient has a history of transplantation and the biopsy finding, the most appropriate next step is to treat the suspected CMV infection.\n\n- Option A (Increase corticosteroids): Not appropriate; corticosteroids are immunosuppressive and would worsen viral infection.\n- Option B (Increase cyclosporine): Would increase immunosuppression and is not indicated in a viral infection.\n- Option C (Begin amphotericin therapy): Amphotericin is for fungal infections (e.g., aspergillosis, candidiasis), not CMV.\n- Option D (Begin ganciclovir therapy): Ganciclovir is the first-line antiviral treatment for CMV infection in transplant patients.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate next step is to initiate ganciclovir therapy.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

Three months ago, he underwent cadaveric renal transplantation resulting in immediate kidney function. At the time of discharge, his serum creatinine concentration was 0.8 mg/dL. He is receiving cyclosporine and corticosteroids. Examination shows no abnormalities. His leukocyte count is 2700/mm3 , and serum creatinine concentration is 1.6 mg/dL; serum cyclosporine concentration is in the therapeutic range. A biopsy of the transplanted kidney shows intracellular inclusion bodies. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?\n Options:\nA. Increase the dosage of corticosteroids\nB. Increase the dosage of cyclosporine\nC. Begin amphotericin therapy\nD. Begin ganciclovir therapy\nAnswer:",
