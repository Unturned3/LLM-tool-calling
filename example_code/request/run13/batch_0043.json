        "text": "The patient presents with signs of androgen excess: increased facial hair (hirsutism), temporal balding, coarse dark hair on the chin and upper lip, clitoral enlargement, and elevated serum testosterone. These findings are consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or an androgen-secreting ovarian tumor. However, the presence of a 12-cm ovarian mass with elevated testosterone and normal levels of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), and urinary 17-ketosteroids suggests that the source of androgens is not adrenal in origin.\n\nKey points:\n- Androstenedione and DHEA are precursors of androgens; their normal levels rule out adrenal origin.\n- Testosterone is elevated, pointing to ovarian production.\n- Clitoral enlargement suggests virilization, which is more commonly associated with ovarian tumors that secrete androgens.\n- A large ovarian mass in a woman with virilization and elevated testosterone raises concern for a tumor that produces androgens.\n\nNow, evaluating the options:\nA. Granulosa cell tumor \u2013 typically produces estrogen, leading to endometrial proliferation, not androgens. May cause gynecomastia or menstrual irregularities, but not typically virilization. Also, these tumors are usually associated with elevated estradiol, not testosterone.\n\nB. Ovarian carcinoid \u2013 a neuroendocrine tumor that may secrete serotonin, causing carcinoid syndrome, not androgens.\n\nC. Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor \u2013 this is a rare ovarian tumor that produces androgens (testosterone) and can cause virilization. It is the most common cause of androgen excess in women with ovarian tumors. These tumors are typically large and produce testosterone, with normal or low levels of adrenal androgens (as seen here). This matches the clinical picture.\n\nD. Teratoma \u2013 usually contains tissue of multiple germ layers, may cause symptoms if malignant or if it produces hormones, but not typically androgen-producing. May cause hormonal imbalances, but not specifically testosterone elevation with virilization.\n\nTherefore, the best choice is:\n\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\n\nThe answer is (C)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?\n Options:\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\nAnswer:",

Works like *The Thinker* exemplify his ability to convey inner tension through textured surfaces and naturalistic gestures.\n\n2. **Anish Kapoor**  \nKapoor (b. 1954) transforms polished stainless steel into immersive, reflective spaces. His technique of casting and polishing creates ethereal, site-responsive forms. *Cloud Gate* exemplifies his use of material to challenge perception and engage viewers through light and movement.\n\n3. **Auguste Rodin**  \nRodin (1840\u20131917) revolutionized sculpture with expressive, dynamic forms. Mastery of bronze and wax enabled emotional depth and fluidity. Works like *The Thinker* exemplify his ability to convey inner tension through textured surfaces and naturalistic gestures.\n\n4. **Louise Nevelson**  \nNevelson (1905\u20131988) pioneered assemblage art using reclaimed wood. Her technique of stacking and painting wood pieces creates bold, monochromatic sculptures. *Untitled (1963)* showcases her mastery of volume, shadow, and material transformation through intricate layering.\n\n5. **David Smith**  \nSmith (1906\u20131975) fused industrial metal with abstract forms. His welding technique in steel produces sharp, geometric sculptures. *Rust and Steel (1967)* reflects his command of form, tension, and material resilience, embodying modernist ideals through structural precision and bold contrasts.",
