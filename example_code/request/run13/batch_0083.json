These findings are characteristic of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).\n\nKey points:\n- CLL is a chronic leukemia of B-lymphocytes.\n- It typically presents with an elevated lymphocyte count, often with mature-appearing lymphocytes on peripheral blood smear.\n- The leukocytosis in CLL is usually due to the accumulation of mature B-lymphocytes, not blast cells.\n- Acute leukemias (A, B, and D) involve blast cells and are typically associated with immature cells, which is not seen here.\n- Acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) involves immature lymphoblasts, not mature lymphocytes.\n- Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) involves myeloid cells, not lymphocytes.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is chronic lymphocytic leukemia.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
