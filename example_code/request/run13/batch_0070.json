        "text": "The study's sample size is reduced from 1000 to 500 patients. Sample size directly affects the statistical power of a study. Power is the probability of correctly rejecting a false null hypothesis (i.e., detecting a true effect when one exists). A smaller sample size reduces the power of the study because it decreases the ability to detect a true difference between groups.\n\nThe alpha level (0.05) is the significance level and remains unchanged. Beta (0.20) is the probability of a type II error, and power = 1 - beta. As sample size decreases, power decreases, which means the chance of a type II error increases.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Chance of a type I error \u2014 This is determined by alpha (0.05), which remains constant. So, not increased.\n\nB. Chance of a type II error \u2014 This increases as power decreases with smaller sample size. This is correct.\n\nC. Power of the study \u2014 This decreases with smaller sample size, so it is not increased.\n\nD. Sensitivity of the study \u2014 Sensitivity refers to the ability of a test to correctly identify true positives (in diagnostic testing). This is not directly related to sample size in the context of a clinical trial comparing treatments. Not relevant here.\n\nTherefore, the most likely to increase with a smaller sample size is the chance of a type II error.\n\nThe answer is (B)",

A total of 1000 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus are enrolled. Patients are randomly assigned to receive the new drug or standard treatment. The alpha and beta values for calculating probability are 0.05 and 0.20, respectively. Results show that the new drug is significantly better than standard treatment. If this study had been performed in a population of only 500 patients, which of the following would have been most likely to increase?\n Options:\nA. Chance of a type I error\nB.
