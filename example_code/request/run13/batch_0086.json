From this article, identify and extract the following specific pieces of information: the accused, the victims, the members of the defense team, the allegations, the duration of the trial, the verdict, the civil lawsuit, the damages awarded, and any subsequent conviction. If any of these elements cannot be found in the article, list them as 'Missing'. Please present each entity with its corresponding extracted value in a new line, using the format: 'Entity Name: Extracted Value'.\nQuestion: Former National Football League player, actor, and broadcaster O.J. Simpson was tried for two accounts of murder in 1994. Simpson was accused of murdering his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and a restaurant waiter, Ron Goldman.\n\nSimpson was represented by a high-profile defense team, that many referred to as the Dream Team. It included famous names like Robert Shapiro, Johnnie Cochran, and Robert Kardashian.\n\nCochran was able to convince the jury that there was reasonable doubt about the DNA evidence, and he alleged misconduct by the Los Angeles Police Department.\n\nThe trial lasted 11 months, and Simpson was found not guilty. Since then, it is often referred to as \u201cthe trial of the century\u201d and there have been television series, movies, and documentaries made about the trial.\n\nHowever, the families of the deceased filed a civil lawsuit against Simpson. The jury unanimously found him guilty for both deaths, and awarded the families $33.5 million for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nMany feel the justice system prevailed 13 years later when Simpson was convicted and sentenced on robbery and weapons charges.\nGeneration:",

        "text": "The Rf value in thin-layer chromatography (TLC) reflects the relative polarity of a compound: a higher Rf value indicates lower polarity (greater affinity for the nonpolar stationary phase and higher mobility on the plate). Therefore, if the products have a significantly higher Rf value than the reactants, the products are less polar than the reactants.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each option:\n\nA. SN2 reaction converting an alkyl bromide to an alkyl chloride  \n- Alkyl bromide is more polar than alkyl chloride due to the higher electronegativity of bromine vs. chlorine. However, both are relatively polar and similar in structure. The change from Br to Cl would likely result in a slightly less polar product, but the difference is small. Also, SN2 reactions typically do not cause large polarity shifts. The Rf increase might be small, but not \"significantly\" higher.\n\nB. Addition reaction converting an alkene to an alcohol  \n- Alkenes are relatively nonpolar; alcohols are polar due to the OH group. So, the product (alcohol) is more polar than the reactant (alkene). This would result in a lower Rf value for the product \u2014 opposite of what is observed. So, this is incorrect.\n\nC. Nucleophilic acyl substitution converting an ester to an anhydride  \n- Esters are moderately polar; anhydrides are more polar than esters due to the presence of two carbonyl groups and increased resonance. So, the product would be more polar \u2192 lower Rf. Again, opposite of the observation. Incorrect.\n\nD. Elimination reaction converting an alcohol to an alkene  \n- Alcohols are polar (due to OH group); alkenes are nonpolar. So, the product (alkene) is less polar than the reactant (alcohol). This would result in a higher Rf value for the product \u2014 consistent with the observation.\n\nThus, the only reaction where the product is significantly less polar than the reactant is elimination of an alcohol to form an alkene.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
