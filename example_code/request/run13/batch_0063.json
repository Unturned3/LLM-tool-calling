        "text": "The patient has a persistent nonproductive cough lasting 6 weeks, without fever, weight loss, or lung disease. She is on enalapril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, for hypertension. ACE inhibitors are known to cause a cough as a side effect, which is often due to the accumulation of bradykinin. ACE inhibitors block the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II, leading to increased levels of bradykinin. Bradykinin stimulates sensory nerves in the airways, leading to coughing.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity \u2013 This is not the primary mechanism of ACE inhibitor-induced cough. Renin activity may be altered, but it is not directly linked to the cough.\n\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations \u2013 This is true due to ACE inhibition, but angiotensin II is not the main mediator of the cough in this context.\n\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations \u2013 Angiotensin I is not significantly increased; it is actually reduced because ACE converts it to angiotensin II. This is not the correct mechanism.\n\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations \u2013 This is correct. ACE inhibitors reduce the breakdown of bradykinin, leading to its accumulation. Bradykinin stimulates cough receptors in the airways, which explains the persistent nonproductive cough.\n\nThus, the most likely mechanism is increased serum bradykinin concentrations.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

She has not had fever or weight loss. She has hypertension treated with enalapril for the past 3 months. She does not smoke. There is no history of lung disease. She weighs 54 kg (120 lb) and is 163 cm (64 in) tall. Her temperature is 37\u00b0C (98.6\u00b0F), blood pressure is 130/80 mm Hg, pulse is 70/min, and respirations are 12/min. Examination and an x-ray of the chest show no abnormalities. Which of the following is the most likely mechanism of this patient's cough?\n Options:\nA. Decreased plasma renin activity\nB. Decreased serum angiotensin II concentrations\nC. Increased serum angiotensin I concentrations\nD. Increased serum bradykinin concentrations\nAnswer:",

In the absence of a clear trigger, systemic illness, or evidence of an underlying condition (such as infection, medication, or autoimmune disease), the treatment of choice is symptomatic relief with antihistamines.\n\nTherefore, treating the symptoms with antihistamines is both appropriate and evidence-based for acute, idiopathic urticaria.\n\nOption A (IgE concentration) and B (eosinophil count) are not routinely indicated in isolated, acute urticaria without evidence of allergy or eosinophilic disorders.\n\nOption C (refer to allergist) is not necessary in the absence of a clear allergic cause or persistent symptoms.\n\nThus, the best initial step is to treat the symptoms.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
