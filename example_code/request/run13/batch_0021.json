This suggests that he has high standards and is critical of his own performance, which may reflect low self-esteem \u2014 because he is constantly measuring himself against others and failing when he doesn't meet those standards.\n\nSelf-efficacy refers to one's belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations. David is trying to master difficult pieces and is working hard, which suggests he believes in his ability to improve \u2014 thus, he has strong self-efficacy.\n\nLocus of control refers to whether a person believes outcomes are due to internal factors (e.g., their own effort) or external factors (e.g., luck, others' abilities). David is hard on himself when he fails, indicating he believes his outcomes depend on his own actions \u2014 this is an internal locus of control.\n\nTherefore, the best description is:\n- Low self-esteem (due to self-criticism and comparison)\n- Strong self-efficacy (due to effort and persistence)\n- Internal locus of control (due to attributing failure to personal shortcomings)\n\nThe answer is (A) is incorrect because it says \"high self-esteem\" \u2014 contradicts the self-criticism described.\n\nOption B says high self-esteem \u2014 not supported by the description.\n\nOption C says low self-esteem and strong self-efficacy, but external locus of control \u2014 contradicts the internal attribution.\n\nOption D says low self-esteem, low self-efficacy \u2014 contradicts the effort and persistence described.\n\nOnly option A has strong self-efficacy and internal locus of control, but it says low self-esteem \u2014 which matches the description.\n\nWait \u2014 option A says: \"Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control\"\n\nThat matches all the traits described.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is (A)",
