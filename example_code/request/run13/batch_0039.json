        "text": "The patient has a history of frostbite, now complicated by necrosis (blackened toes), cellulitis, and systemic signs of infection (fever, confusion), suggesting a severe soft tissue infection with possible osteomyelitis or sepsis. The black coloration indicates extensive tissue necrosis, likely due to ischemia and infarction from frostbite, and the presence of cellulitis and systemic symptoms points to a serious, possibly spreading infection.\n\nGiven the progression to systemic illness and necrotic tissue, the most appropriate intervention is surgical debridement of necrotic tissue to remove infected and dead tissue, which is essential to prevent the spread of infection and to allow healing. While amputation may be considered in severe cases, it is typically reserved for when debridement is not feasible or when there is extensive, irreparable tissue loss. In this case, debridement is the first-line surgical intervention to manage the infection and necrosis.\n\nTopical collagenase (option B) is used for debridement of necrotic tissue in specific settings, such as in wounds with significant necrosis, but it is not the first-line or most appropriate treatment when there is systemic infection and cellulitis. Hyperbaric oxygen (option D) may be used in specific cases of compromised tissue perfusion or infection, but it is not the primary treatment for established necrotic tissue and infection.\n\nAmputation (option A) is a last resort, especially when the tissue is still potentially salvageable with debridement.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate initial treatment is debridement of necrotic skin over the toes.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet. All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot.
