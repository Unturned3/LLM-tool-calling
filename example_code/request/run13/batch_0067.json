The gustatory system detects chemicals in food, and the olfactory system detects airborne chemical molecules. In contrast, the auditory system detects mechanical vibrations (sound waves), which is a physical, not a chemical, stimulus.\n\nTherefore, the chemically based sensory systems are I (gustatory) and III (olfactory).\n\nThe answer is (D)",
