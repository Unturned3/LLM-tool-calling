This is a silent mutation in terms of amino acid change (same amino acid or different, but not a stop or frameshift).\n\nHowever, the key point is: **Is there a stop codon involved?**\n\nLook at the sequence again:\n\nOriginal: \u2026AUACAGUAACAGA  \nModified: \u2026AUACAGUACCAGA\n\nThe original ends with \"UACAGUAACAGA\" \u2014 no stop codon. The stop codon would be UAA, UAG, or UGA.\n\nIn the original:  \n- UAC \u2192 Tyr  \n- AGU \u2192 Ser  \n- AAC \u2192 Asn  \n- AGA \u2192 Arg\n\nNo stop codon.\n\nIn the modified:  \n- UAC \u2192 Tyr  \n- AGU \u2192 Ser  \n- ACC \u2192 Thr  \n- CAG \u2192 Gln\n\nStill no stop codon.\n\nThe mutation is a **single nucleotide substitution** (A \u2192 C) in the codon AAC \u2192 ACC. This is a **missense mutation**, changing one amino acid (Asn \u2192 Thr), but not altering the reading frame or introducing a stop codon.\n\nTherefore, the protein would still be produced, but with a different amino acid \u2014 so it may be **dysfunctional**, but not absent or significantly larger.\n\nThus, the most likely outcome is:\n\n**B. Production of a similar-sized but dysfunctional protein**\n\nThe answer is (B)",
