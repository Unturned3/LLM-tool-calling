The \"red cloak\" refers to the wolf's traditional red coat (often depicted in illustrations), the \"pointy hat\" is a playful reference to the wolf's bushy tail and the way it is sometimes drawn with a hat-like shape. The \"stick\" could be a reference to the wolf using a stick to push down the pigs' houses. The key clue is that the wolf lives in a forest, which is part of the story's setting, and he is a well-known villain in a classic fairy tale. The riddle is simple, age-appropriate, and fun for children to solve.",

This suggests that glucose homeostasis is maintained through mechanisms that prevent hypoglycemia.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal \u2014 This is not possible after 12 hours of fasting. The meal is already absorbed, and gut absorption does not occur after digestion is complete. So this is not correct.\n\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle \u2014 Skeletal muscle does not release glucose into the bloodstream under normal conditions. It can take up glucose, but it does not release it into circulation. So this is incorrect.\n\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver \u2014 This is a key mechanism for maintaining blood glucose during fasting. After a meal, blood glucose rises, and insulin promotes glycogen synthesis. During fasting (like the 12-hour period), the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose and releases it into the blood. This is a primary mechanism for maintaining normal serum glucose levels during overnight fasting.\n\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues \u2014 Leptin is released in response to fat stores and helps regulate appetite and energy balance. While it plays a role in metabolism, it does not directly maintain serum glucose concentration. It is not a primary mechanism for glucose homeostasis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism responsible for maintaining serum glucose concentration during the 12-hour fasting period is glycogenolysis in the liver.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
