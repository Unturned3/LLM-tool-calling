        "text": "The patient is a 36-year-old man with new-onset headaches that are morning headaches, relieved by over-the-counter analgesics, and associated with recent significant life stress (promotion and relocation). The key finding is bilateral blurring of the optic disc margins, which is a classic sign of increased intracranial pressure (IICP), such as in pseudotumor cerebri (idiopathic intracranial hypertension).\n\nThis presentation is highly suggestive of idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH), especially in young women, but it can occur in men as well. The optic disc edema is a hallmark finding and warrants prompt evaluation and management.\n\nWhile imaging (CT scan) may be used in some cases, it is not the first step in this scenario. CT is less sensitive for detecting increased intracranial pressure compared to MRI, and it does not assess for optic disc changes. EEG is not indicated for headaches without seizure history. \n\nThe most appropriate next step is to refer the patient to a neurologist for further evaluation and management, including possible lumbar puncture to measure opening pressure and rule out other causes.\n\nThus, the best answer is:\n\nThe answer is (D)",

        "text": "The patient is a 47-year-old man who sustained a femoral fracture in a motor vehicle collision and underwent open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) four days postoperatively. He now presents with agitation, confusion, tremulousness, and disorientation (oriented to person but not place or time), despite treatment with haloperidol. His vital signs show mild hypertension, and the head CT is normal. There is no evidence of sepsis, alcohol withdrawal, or focal neurologic deficits.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Adverse effect of medication \u2013 While haloperidol can cause extrapyramidal side effects, the patient is already on it and the symptoms (agitation, tremulousness, confusion) are not typical of a simple medication side effect. Also, the confusion is not fully explained by antipsychotic side effects, especially without other signs like rigidity or dystonia. Additionally, he is uncooperative and has no focal signs, which makes a medication adverse effect less likely as the primary cause.\n\nB. Alcohol withdrawal \u2013 This would typically present with tremors, autonomic hyperactivity, and delirium (e.g., in delirium tremens), often with a history of alcohol use and withdrawal. There is no mention of alcohol use or history in the case, and the presentation is more consistent with a postoperative, non-acute intoxication or metabolic issue.\n\nC. Fat emboli \u2013 This is a well-known complication following long bone fractures (especially femoral fractures), typically occurring within 24\u201372 hours post-injury. It presents with confusion, agitation, respiratory distress, petechiae, and neurologic abnormalities. The timing (4 days post-fracture) is slightly beyond the classic window, but fat embolism can have a delayed onset. However, it is typically associated with respiratory symptoms and petechiae. The patient has no mention of respiratory distress or petechiae. Still, confusion and agitation can occur, and the absence of head CT abnormalities supports a non-structural cause.\n\nD. Sepsis \u2013 Sepsis would present with fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, and systemic inflammatory signs. The patient has a normal temperature (37.2\u00b0C), mild hypertension, and no signs of infection. There is no evidence of fever, leukocytosis, or other systemic signs. Sepsis is less likely.\n\nHowever, consider the classic triad of fat embolism: respiratory distress, petechial rash, and neurologic symptoms. While respiratory symptoms are missing, the neurologic confusion and agitation in a post-fracture patient, especially with a long bone fracture, is a red flag.\n\nBut note: fat embolism typically occurs within the first 24\u201372 hours, and the patient is 4 days post-op. This is slightly late. However, some sources describe delayed fat embolism in up to 72 hours.\n\nMore importantly, the absence of respiratory symptoms and petechiae makes fat embolism less likely.\n\nNow reconsider: the patient has no focal neurologic deficits, normal head CT, and mild hypertension. The agitation and confusion could be due to a metabolic or postoperative complication.\n\nAnother possibility: **fat embolism syndrome (FES)** is the most common cause of post-femoral fracture confusion, even if the timing is slightly delayed. The neurologic symptoms (confusion, tremulousness) are classic, and the absence of focal signs and normal CT supports a non-traumatic, non-infectious cause.\n\nDespite the timing, fat embolism is still the most likely cause in this context.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause is:\n\nC. Fat emboli\n\nThe answer is (C)",
