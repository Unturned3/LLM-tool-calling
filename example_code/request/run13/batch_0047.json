        "text": "**Childhood and Upbringing**  \nGeorge Washington\u2019s early years were shaped by the quiet, disciplined environment of his Virginia plantation, Mount Vernon, where he was raised with a strong sense of duty and honor. Though his father, Augustine Washington, was a prominent landowner, it was Martha Washington\u2014his wife and the mother of his children\u2014who provided the emotional foundation that would endure throughout his life. Martha, a woman of intelligence and resilience, instilled in George the values of patience, compassion, and moral integrity. Her influence was especially evident during Washington\u2019s formative years, as she guided him through personal challenges and encouraged his sense of responsibility. Their marriage, forged in 1759, was a partnership built on mutual respect and shared purpose. Martha\u2019s steady presence during Washington\u2019s military campaigns and later in his presidency offered a grounding force that balanced his public demands with private devotion.\n\n**Revolutionary War Leadership**  \nDuring the Revolutionary War, Washington\u2019s leadership was not only defined by military strategy but also by the personal support of Martha Washington. While he led the Continental Army through harsh winters and critical battles, Martha remained a constant source of emotional strength. She managed the household at Mount Vernon, ensuring that Washington could focus on duty without distraction. Her letters to him, often filled with practical advice and quiet encouragement, helped sustain his morale during moments of doubt. In 1775, when Washington faced the challenges of organizing a unified army and managing supply lines, Martha\u2019s belief in his mission bolstered his resolve. Her influence extended beyond comfort; she helped shape his leadership style\u2014calm under pressure, fair in judgment, and deeply committed to the ideals of liberty. This personal stability allowed Washington to lead with both authority and empathy, a quality that would define his role in the war effort.\n\n**Presidency**  \nAs the first President of the United States, Washington faced the monumental task of establishing a new nation\u2019s political foundation. Martha\u2019s influence continued to shape his approach to leadership. Though she did not hold public office, her presence at the White House and her counsel on matters of family and public virtue were deeply valued. During the early years of the presidency, Washington emphasized unity, restraint, and the importance of civic virtue\u2014values he had learned from Martha and reinforced through his relationship with her. In his farewell address, he warned against political factions and foreign entanglements, reflecting the moral clarity and stability he associated with their marriage. Martha\u2019s quiet strength and dedication served as a model for the presidency\u2019s moral tone. Her role, though behind the scenes, was essential in shaping Washington\u2019s legacy as a leader of integrity and personal principle.\n\nWashington\u2019s life reveals how personal relationships can profoundly influence public service. Martha Washington was not just a wife but a foundational force in his character and leadership.",

        "text": "The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, and temporary discontinuation of anticoagulation with placement of an IVC filter. She now presents with a persistent, localized sensation of tingling and numbness over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. The sensory deficit is localized and corresponds to the distribution of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, which innervates the lateral thigh.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization \u2014 Unlikely. There is no history of neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or visual changes. The sensory deficit is localized to the thigh, not involving the central nervous system.\n\nB. Complication of the IVC filter placement \u2014 IVC filters are placed to prevent embolization and are not typically associated with peripheral nerve compression or sensory deficits in the thigh. Complications are more likely to involve venous thrombosis or filter migration, not sensory changes in the thigh.\n\nC. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve \u2014 This nerve arises from the lumbar plexus (L2-L4) and innervates the lateral thigh. It is commonly compressed due to local pressure, such as from a hematoma, swelling, or post-surgical changes. In this patient, a hematoma that was resolving 2 weeks ago could have caused transient compression of this nerve, leading to a sensory disturbance. The fact that symptoms have improved somewhat over the past week supports a temporary, compressive etiology.\n\nD. Hematoma of the left thigh \u2014 While the patient had a hematoma, it is resolving and not currently present. A hematoma would likely cause pain or swelling, not a specific sensory deficit limited to the lateral thigh. Moreover, hematoma-induced sensory changes are typically associated with pain or swelling, not isolated numbness.\n\nThe most likely cause of the localized sensory loss in the lateral thigh is compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, possibly due to prior hematoma or local pressure.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

        "prompt": "The following is a multiple choice question (with answers) about  professional medicine.  Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n Options:\nA. Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\nB. Complication of the IVC filter placement\nC. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\nD. Hematoma of the left thigh\nAnswer:",
