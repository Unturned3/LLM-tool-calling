        "text": "The patient has sarcoidosis and is on long-term glucocorticoid therapy. His new complaint is leg pain that worsens with weight-bearing, with mild left hip pain on both active and passive range of motion. He has no neurological deficits, and dorsalis pedis pulses are intact, ruling out peripheral vascular disease or significant nerve involvement. The pain is weight-bearing and localized to the hip, which is concerning for a condition that develops with glucocorticoid use.\n\nGlucocorticoids are well known to cause osteoporosis, which increases the risk of fractures and bone pain, especially in weight-bearing joints. While avascular necrosis of the femoral head (option A) can present with hip pain and is associated with glucocorticoid use, it typically presents with more severe pain, especially with movement, and often has a history of trauma or high-dose steroid use. However, avascular necrosis may not always present with pain early on, and the pain may be more localized to the hip and groin.\n\nIn contrast, osteoporosis is a common and well-documented side effect of long-term glucocorticoid therapy, leading to bone fragility, pain, and joint-related discomfort, especially in weight-bearing areas. The patient\u2019s symptoms \u2014 pain with weight-bearing, mild hip pain, no neurological deficits, and normal pulses \u2014 are consistent with osteoporosis-related bone pain rather than a mechanical joint problem like a herniated disc (B) or joint narrowing (C), which would be more likely to cause mechanical symptoms or radiating pain.\n\nMoreover, osteoporosis can cause diffuse bone pain, including in the hips, and is especially common in patients on long-term glucocorticoid therapy. Given the chronic nature of the steroid use and the absence of other red flags, osteoporosis is the most likely cause.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

        "text": "The most appropriate initial investigation for a thyroid nodule, especially when evaluating a newly detected, freely movable mass, is to assess its characteristics non-invasively and to determine whether it is likely to be benign or malignant. While thyroid function tests (TSH and free T4) are already being ordered, the next step in evaluating a thyroid nodule is to obtain structural and echographic information.\n\nUltrasonography of the thyroid gland is the first-line imaging modality for evaluating thyroid nodules. It helps determine the size, shape, margins, echogenicity, and presence of microcalcifications, which are important in assessing the risk of malignancy. This is particularly valuable in guiding further management, including whether fine-needle aspiration (FNA) is needed.\n\nFine-needle aspiration (C) is the gold standard for diagnosing thyroid cancer, but it is typically performed only after ultrasound findings suggest a suspicious nodule. Therefore, it is not the most appropriate *initial* investigation.\n\nNuclear thyroid scans (A and B) are less commonly used in the evaluation of a simple, asymptomatic thyroid nodule and are typically reserved for specific indications, such as evaluating for hyperthyroidism or to assess thyroid function in a nodular goiter. Iodine-131 scans are not used for initial evaluation of thyroid nodules in this context.\n\nThus, the most appropriate initial method to investigate this lesion is ultrasonography.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
