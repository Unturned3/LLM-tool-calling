        "text": "The patient is a 37-year-old man with alcoholic cirrhosis and esophageal varices who has now vomited bright red blood and is hypotensive with signs of shock. This is a classic presentation of variceal bleeding, which is a medical emergency. The most immediate and critical step in managing active variceal hemorrhage is to control the bleeding, and the first-line intervention is endoscopic therapy, specifically endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL) or banding, which is both effective and rapidly available.\n\nWhile vasopressin (option B) can be used to reduce portal pressure and is a reasonable intervention in the acute setting, it is not the most appropriate *immediate* management when endoscopy is available and feasible. In fact, endoscopy is the gold standard for both diagnosis and treatment of active variceal bleeding. It allows for immediate intervention to stop the bleeding (e.g., with banding) and is the first-line step in such cases.\n\nOption A (transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunt) is a definitive procedure, but it is not appropriate as an immediate management step in the emergency setting; it is reserved for patients who are refractory to medical therapy and are not candidates for surgery.\n\nOption C (endotracheal intubation) is not indicated here \u2014 there is no indication of airway compromise or respiratory failure.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate immediate management is upper endoscopy to evaluate and treat the bleeding varices.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

Medical history is significant for esophageal varices secondary to alcohol-related cirrhosis and ascites treated with spironolactone. He drinks eight to ten alcoholic beverages daily. While you are obtaining additional history, the patient vomits a large volume of bright red blood and becomes difficult to arouse. Vital signs are temperature 36.0\u00b0C (96.8\u00b0F), pulse 110/min, respirations 12/min, and blood pressure 90/50 mm Hg. Following initiation of intravenous fluids, which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?\n Options:\nA. Arrange for transjugular intrahepatic portal vein shunting\nB. Begin intravenous vasopressin therapy\nC. Do endotracheal intubation\nD. Do upper endoscopy\nAnswer:",

        "text": "The patient is a 22-year-old woman who received a kidney transplant six weeks ago and is currently on immunosuppressive therapy (azathioprine, cyclosporine, prednisone). She has a 3-day history of cold symptoms, a 1-week history of progressive fatigue, fever (39\u00b0C), and a marked rise in serum urea nitrogen and creatinine\u2014indicating acute kidney injury. The clinical scenario raises concern for allograft rejection, but the presence of a viral infection that mimics rejection or directly causes acute kidney injury in transplant recipients must be considered.\n\nAmong the listed options:\n\n- **A. Adenovirus**: A common cause of post-transplant infections, especially in the first few months after transplant. Adenovirus can cause febrile illness, fatigue, and acute kidney injury. It is a well-known cause of acute tubular necrosis and can present with symptoms resembling rejection. It is particularly common in immunosuppressed patients.\n\n- **B. BK virus**: Can cause nephropathy in transplant recipients, especially with chronic kidney disease or in the setting of immunosuppression. However, BK virus infection typically presents with proteinuria, hematuria, and progressive decline in renal function, often over weeks to months, and is more commonly associated with chronic graft dysfunction rather than acute onset with fever and fatigue.\n\n- **C. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)**: Can cause infectious mononucleosis, with fatigue, fever, and pharyngitis. EBV is associated with increased risk of post-transplant complications, including lymphoproliferative disorders, but it is not typically a direct cause of acute kidney injury or rapidly rising creatinine.\n\n- **D. Herpes simplex virus (HSV)**: Can cause skin, mucosal, or systemic infections, and in immunocompromised patients, it may lead to severe disease. However, it is less commonly associated with acute renal failure and is not a primary cause of post-transplant acute kidney injury.\n\nGiven the patient\u2019s recent transplant, immunosuppression, fever, fatigue, and acute deterioration in renal function, **adenovirus** is the most likely cause of both the acute kidney injury and the clinical presentation resembling rejection. Adenovirus is a leading cause of post-transplant viral nephritis and can present with fever, fatigue, and rising creatinine.\n\nThe answer is (A)",
