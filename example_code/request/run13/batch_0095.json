        "text": "The patient is a 65-year-old woman with a long-standing neck mass, progressive symptoms of hyperthyroidism (irritability, palpitations, heat intolerance, weight loss, bowel movements), and a 131I scan showing an enlarged thyroid with both increased and decreased uptake. This pattern of heterogeneous uptake is characteristic of a multinodular goiter, which can contain both hyperfunctioning (hot) and hypofunctioning (cold) nodules. While Graves' disease typically presents with diffuse increased uptake on a 131I scan and is associated with autoimmune markers, the presence of multiple areas of increased and decreased uptake is more consistent with a multinodular goiter, especially in an older patient with a long-standing neck mass.\n\nGraves' disease (B) usually shows diffuse, uniform increased uptake, not heterogeneous uptake. A defect in T4 biosynthesis (A) would present with hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism. Riedel's thyroiditis (D) is a chronic, fibrosing inflammation that typically presents with a firm, fixed thyroid mass and hypothyroidism, not hyperthyroidism.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is a multinodular goiter.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
