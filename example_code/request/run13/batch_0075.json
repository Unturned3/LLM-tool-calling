        "text": "The question asks which process will usually lead to a decrease in gene expression when acting on DNA. This involves understanding epigenetic regulation, particularly histone modifications and chromatin structure.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate each option:\n\nA. Increased histone acetyltransferase activity \u2013 Acetylation of histones neutralizes their positive charge, loosening chromatin structure and promoting gene expression. Therefore, this increases gene expression, not decreases it. Incorrect.\n\nB. Decrease in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity \u2013 HDAC removes acetyl groups; less HDAC activity means less deacetylation, so more acetylation, leading to open chromatin and increased gene expression. So this also increases expression. Incorrect.\n\nC. Increase in methylation activity \u2013 Histone methylation can either activate or repress genes depending on the site. For example, H3K9me and H3K27me are repressive marks associated with heterochromatin. However, methylation is not universally repressive. This option is somewhat plausible but context-dependent.\n\nD. Increase in heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio \u2013 Heterochromatin is tightly packed and transcriptionally inactive; euchromatin is open and active. An increase in heterochromatin relative to euchromatin means less accessible DNA and reduced gene expression. This directly leads to decreased gene expression.\n\nTherefore, the most direct and consistent effect leading to decreased gene expression is an increased heterochromatin:euchromatin ratio.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
