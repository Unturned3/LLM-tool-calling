Key features include:\n\n- Painless bilateral ankle swelling (peripheral edema)\n- Dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea (awakened by shortness of breath)\n- Elevated jugular venous pressure (15 cm H2O, which is elevated)\n- Crackles at lung bases (pulmonary congestion)\n- S3 gallop (suggestive of left ventricular dysfunction)\n- Holosystolic murmur at apex (suggestive of mitral regurgitation)\n- Pitting edema\n\nAmong the options:\n\n- A. Serum troponin I: useful for diagnosing myocardial injury (e.g., myocardial infarction), but not specific for heart failure.\n- B. ECG: can detect arrhythmias or signs of myocardial strain (e.g., left ventricular hypertrophy), but not definitive for diagnosing heart failure.\n- C. Exercise stress test: may be used in evaluating cardiac function or ischemia, but not the best initial test to confirm heart failure etiology.\n- D. Echocardiography: the gold standard to assess cardiac structure and function. It can confirm left ventricular systolic dysfunction, evaluate ejection fraction, detect valvular abnormalities (e.g., mitral regurgitation), and assess the cause of heart failure.\n\nGiven the clinical picture, echocardiography is most likely to confirm the diagnosis of heart failure and identify its underlying cause (e.g., systolic dysfunction, valvular disease).\n\nThe answer is (D)",

He has a history of long-term smoking and hypertension. The decreased femoral pulses suggest possible arterial compromise. The ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, which is common in hypertension and aortic disease.\n\nKey findings:\n- Diastolic murmur over left sternal border radiating to right sternal border: This is highly suggestive of aortic regurgitation or aortic dissection.\n- Decreased femoral pulses: This is concerning for aortic dissection, especially if there is aortic regurgitation or dissection involving the descending aorta.\n- Hypertension and smoking are risk factors for aortic dissection.\n- The sudden onset of chest pain with systemic symptoms (sweating, tachycardia) is classic for aortic dissection.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\nA. Acute myocardial infarction: Would typically present with ST-segment changes on ECG, elevated cardiac biomarkers, and pain radiating to jaw or arm. While chest pain and LVH can be seen, the diastolic murmur and decreased pulses are atypical for MI alone. Also, the murmur is not typical of MI.\nB. Aortic dissection: Classic presentation includes sudden, severe chest or back pain, often described as \"tearing,\" with associated hypertension, altered pulses, and ECG findings such as LVH. The diastolic murmur (especially if due to aortic regurgitation from dissection) and decreased pulses are consistent with aortic dissection. This is a life-threatening emergency.\nC. Esophageal rupture: Presents with sudden severe chest pain, often with vomiting and signs of peritonitis. It is rare and would not typically present with a diastolic murmur or decreased pulses.\nD. Mitral valve prolapse: Usually presents with nonspecific symptoms, palpitations, or a click and murmur, but not typically with severe chest pain, decreased pulses, or LVH. The murmur would be more likely systolic and not diastolic.\n\nThe combination of sudden chest pain, diastolic murmur, decreased pulses, and hypertension strongly points to aortic dissection.\n\nThe answer is (B)",
