        "text": "The patient has a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration, which suggests early pressure injury or pressure ulcer, not an infection. He is quadriplegic due to multiple sclerosis, placing him at high risk for pressure-related skin damage. The key point is that the lesion is not yet ulcerated or infected, and there is no evidence of infection (e.g., no purulent discharge, no fever, negative stool occult blood).\n\nThe most effective intervention for a non-ulcerated pressure injury (early pressure injury) in a bedridden patient is **frequent turning** to relieve pressure and prevent further tissue damage. This is a cornerstone of pressure injury prevention and management.\n\n- Option A (Frequent turning): Correct. Prevents pressure on the sacrum and promotes skin integrity.\n- Option B (Wet to dry dressings): Used for infected or necrotic wounds, not for early erythema.\n- Option C (Whirlpool therapy): Used for infected wounds or specific types of skin ulcers, not appropriate here.\n- Option D (Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy): Not indicated without signs of infection.\n\nThe lesion is not infected, so antibiotics are unnecessary.\n\nThe answer is (A)",

Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 65-year-old man who is quadriplegic as a result of multiple sclerosis is hospitalized for treatment of left lower lobe pneumonia. His temperature is 38.1\u00b0C (100.5\u00b0F), pulse is 95/min, respirations are 12/min, and blood pressure is 120/80 mm Hg. He appears malnourished. Rhonchi are heard at the left lower lobe of the lung on auscultation. Examination of the heart, lymph nodes, abdomen, and extremities shows no abnormalities. There is a 1-cm area of erythema over the sacrum with intact skin and no induration. Neurologic examination shows quadriparesis. Test of the stool for occult blood is negative.
