While other steroids like cortisol, progesterone, and aldosterone have similar structural features, they are not used for performance enhancement in the same way. Cortisol is a catabolic hormone, progesterone is involved in reproductive functions, and aldosterone regulates electrolyte balance.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is A.\n\nThe answer is (A)",
