Substance abuse during adolescence, a period of significant brain development, can lead to structural and functional abnormalities in the prefrontal cortex, particularly affecting executive functioning. This is well-documented in studies involving alcohol, cocaine, and other drugs.\n\nImpulse control deficits are a hallmark of impaired executive function and are commonly observed in individuals with substance use disorders, especially after prolonged abuse during adolescence.\n\nAuditory hallucinations are more commonly associated with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, not directly with diminished executive function due to substance abuse alone. While substance use can contribute to psychosis in some cases, increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations is not a typical or primary feature of executive dysfunction from substance abuse during adolescence.\n\nTherefore:\n- I (pathological changes to the prefrontal cortex) is true.\n- III (reduced behavioral impulse control) is true.\n- II (increased susceptibility to auditory hallucinations) is less likely and not directly supported.\n\nThe correct answer is C: I and III only.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
