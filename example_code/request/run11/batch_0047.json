        "text": "**Childhood and Upbringing**  \nGeorge Washington\u2019s early life was shaped by the quiet, disciplined influence of his wife, Martha Dandridge Custis. Though their marriage in 1759 came after Washington\u2019s first wife, Mary Ball Washington, passed away, Martha\u2019s presence became the emotional cornerstone of his personal development. A woman of strong moral character and quiet resilience, Martha provided a stabilizing force in Washington\u2019s life, especially during the formative years of his military and political ambitions. She instilled in him values of duty, integrity, and family\u2014qualities that would define his leadership. At a time when frontier life demanded self-reliance, Martha\u2019s nurturing presence balanced Washington\u2019s ambitious nature with a deep sense of responsibility. Their shared commitment to honor and home life laid the foundation for his later public service.\n\n**Revolutionary War Leadership**  \nDuring the Revolutionary War, Washington\u2019s relationship with Martha remained a steady anchor amid the chaos and uncertainty of battle. While he led the Continental Army with strategic brilliance, it was Martha\u2019s unwavering support\u2014both emotionally and logistically\u2014that helped sustain his resolve. She managed the household, cared for their children, and ensured that Washington could focus on military operations without distraction. Her letters and correspondence, though rarely public, reveal a deep understanding of the burdens of war and a belief in the moral necessity of independence. This partnership allowed Washington to maintain discipline and morale among his troops. Martha also subtly influenced his views on governance and justice, reinforcing his belief in republican values and civic duty. Their shared commitment to the cause of liberty strengthened Washington\u2019s resolve, even during setbacks like the winter at Valley Forge.\n\n**Presidency**  \nAs the first President of the United States, Washington\u2019s leadership was marked by a profound sense of duty, a trait deeply rooted in his marriage to Martha. Though he did not rely on political allies like Alexander Hamilton or Thomas Jefferson for policy direction, his personal relationship with Martha provided a model of private virtue that shaped his public image. During his presidency, Washington emphasized unity, restraint, and the importance of a strong, stable government. Martha\u2019s influence is evident in his decisions to avoid party politics and to prioritize national cohesion over personal ambition. In his farewell address, Washington explicitly referenced the need for civic virtue\u2014a value he had learned through his marriage and family life. The Washingtons\u2019 shared devotion to duty, honor, and service became a symbol of the new republic\u2019s ideals. Martha, though never in office, remained a silent but powerful force behind the man who led the nation into its formative years.\n\n(Word count: 498)",

        "text": "The patient has a history of pulmonary embolism, retroperitoneal hemorrhage, temporary discontinuation of anticoagulation, and placement of an IVC filter. She now presents with a new, localized sensory disturbance \u2014 decreased sensation to light touch over a 5 x 5 cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. The sensation has improved somewhat over the past week, and there is no motor weakness or skin abnormalities.\n\nKey points:\n- The lateral aspect of the thigh is innervated by the **lateral femoral cutaneous nerve**, a branch of the lumbar plexus (from the L2-L3 nerves).\n- This nerve is commonly affected by **compression**, especially in the context of a hematoma or swelling in the surrounding soft tissues.\n- The patient had a **hematoma that was resolving** at the time of discharge \u2014 this could have caused localized pressure or compression on the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve, leading to transient sensory changes.\n- The sensation is localized and improving, which is consistent with a **temporary nerve compression** rather than a systemic or central event.\n- Option A (cerebral infarction) would likely present with neurological deficits such as hemiparesis, aphasia, or altered mental status \u2014 not isolated sensory changes in the thigh.\n- Option B (complication of IVC filter placement) is unlikely \u2014 IVC filters are placed to prevent pulmonary embolism and do not typically cause sensory deficits in the thigh.\n- Option D (hematoma of the left thigh) is plausible, but the hematoma is resolving, and the sensory change is localized to a specific dermatome \u2014 more specifically, the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve territory.\n\nTherefore, the most likely cause is **compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve**, which can occur due to soft tissue swelling or hematoma, even if resolving.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

        "prompt": "The following is a multiple choice question (with answers) about  professional medicine.  Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 67-year-old woman comes to the physician for a follow-up examination. She had a pulmonary embolism and required treatment in the hospital for 3 weeks. She had a retroperitoneal hemorrhage; anticoagulant therapy was temporarily discontinued, and she underwent placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. She had a hematoma that was resolving on discharge from the hospital 2 weeks ago. Today, she says she has had a persistent sensation of tingling and numbness of her left thigh that she did not report in the hospital because she thought it would go away; the sensation has improved somewhat during the past week. Her only medication is warfarin. Vital signs are within normal limits. Examination of the skin shows no abnormalities. Muscle strength is normal. Sensation to light touch is decreased over a 5 x 5-cm area on the lateral aspect of the left anterior thigh. Which of the following is the most likely cause of this patient's decreased sensation?\n Options:\nA. Cerebral infarction during the hospitalization\nB. Complication of the IVC filter placement\nC. Compression of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve\nD. Hematoma of the left thigh\nAnswer:",
