If breathing is difficult, seek medical attention.  \n- **Skin contact**: Wash with soap and water. No special treatment required.  \n- **Eye contact**: Rinse thoroughly with water for at least 15 minutes. Seek medical advice if irritation persists.  \n- **Ingestion**: Do not induce vomiting. If large quantities are consumed, seek medical advice, especially in individuals with pre-existing health conditions such as kidney disease or heart conditions.  \n\nNote: Ingestion of large amounts may lead to hyponatremia or dehydration. Immediate medical evaluation is recommended in such cases.  \n\n---  \n*This Safety Data Sheet is based on established chemical and health data from authoritative sources including the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the American Chemical Society (ACS).*",
