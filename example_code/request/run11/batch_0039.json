        "text": "The patient has a history of frostbite, now complicated by necrosis (blackened toes), cellulitis, fever, and confusion\u2014signs of systemic infection and possible sepsis. The blackened toes indicate tissue necrosis due to ischemia and possible infarction, which may have progressed to osteomyelitis or septicemia. The presence of fever and confusion suggests systemic involvement, indicating a potentially life-threatening condition.\n\nOption A: Amputation \u2014 This may be necessary if there is extensive necrosis and infection that cannot be controlled with conservative measures, especially if there is a high risk of sepsis. However, amputation is a definitive surgical intervention and not the first-line or most appropriate treatment in the absence of clear indications such as uncontrolled infection or non-viable tissue.\n\nOption B: Application of topical collagenase \u2014 This is used in the management of foreign body or surgical wound debridement, particularly in cases of tendon or joint debridement, not typically for frostbite-related necrosis or systemic infection.\n\nOption C: Debridement of necrotic skin over the toes \u2014 This is appropriate in the setting of necrotic tissue to prevent infection spread and promote healing. However, in a patient with systemic signs of infection (fever, confusion), the infection may have already spread beyond the skin, and debridement alone may not be sufficient.\n\nOption D: Hyperbaric oxygen \u2014 This is used in specific cases such as gas gangrene, carbon monoxide poisoning, or compromised tissue perfusion due to ischemia. It may help in improving tissue oxygenation in ischemic tissue, but it is not the most appropriate first-line treatment for infected frostbite with systemic signs.\n\nHowever, in frostbite with extensive necrosis and signs of sepsis, the most appropriate intervention is often surgical debridement of necrotic tissue to prevent progression of infection. In this case, the patient has cellulitis and systemic signs, so debridement is indicated to remove necrotic tissue and reduce the risk of sepsis. Amputation may be considered later if debridement fails.\n\nBut among the options, **debridement of necrotic skin over the toes** (Option C) is the most appropriate initial intervention to manage the localized infection and necrosis, especially before considering more radical measures like amputation.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

He was treated by rapid rewarming and protective care of the feet. All the toes on the right foot have turned black. He has become slightly febrile and progressively more confused during the past few days. Examination discloses cellulitis in the midfoot.
