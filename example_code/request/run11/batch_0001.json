Schr\u00f6dinger Equation**\n\n- Describes how the quantum state of a physical system evolves over time.  \n- Central equation in non-relativistic quantum mechanics.  \n- Applies to particles with negligible relativistic effects (e.g., electrons in atoms).  \n\n- **Time-Dependent Schr\u00f6dinger Equation**:  \n  \\[\n  i\\hbar \\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t} \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t) = \\hat{H} \\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\n  \\]  \n  where \\(\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)\\) is the wave function, \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck constant, and \\(\\hat{H}\\) is the Hamiltonian operator.\n\n- **Time-Independent Schr\u00f6dinger Equation** (for stationary states):  \n  \\[\n  \\hat{H} \\psi(\\mathbf{r}) = E \\psi(\\mathbf{r})\n  \\]  \n  Used to find energy eigenvalues and eigenfunctions (e.g., in infinite well or hydrogen atom).\n\n- The wave function \\(\\Psi\\) contains all information about the system\u2019s probabilities.  \n- Probability density is given by \\(|\\Psi(\\mathbf{r}, t)|^2\\).\n\n---\n\n**2. Dirac Equation**\n\n- A relativistic wave equation developed by Paul Dirac in 1928.  \n- Combines quantum mechanics with special relativity.  \n- Predicts electron spin and antimatter (positrons).  \n\n- **Dirac Equation** (in free space):  \n  \\[\n  \\left( i\\hbar \\gamma^\\mu \\partial_\\mu - mc \\right) \\psi = 0\n  \\]  \n  where \\(\\psi\\) is the four-component spinor wave function, \\(\\gamma^\\mu\\) are Dirac gamma matrices, and \\(m\\) is the electron mass.\n\n- Naturally incorporates spin-1/2 particles and predicts the existence of antiparticles.  \n- Resolves issues of negative energy states via the Dirac sea interpretation.  \n- Reduces to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in the non-relativistic limit (\\(v \\ll c\\)).  \n\n- Provides a foundation for quantum field theory and the Standard Model.",
