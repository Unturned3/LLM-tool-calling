        "text": "The organism described\u2014gram-negative diplococci causing recurrent urethritis in a sexually active man\u2014is Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the causative agent of gonorrhea. The key feature here is recurrent infection despite prior episodes, which suggests that the organism is able to evade the host immune response.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Antigenic variation \u2014 This is a mechanism used by some pathogens (e.g., HIV, malaria, *Treponema pallidum*) to escape immune detection by changing surface antigens. However, *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* does not exhibit significant antigenic variation like those seen in other pathogens. Instead, it has other immune evasion mechanisms.\n\nB. Catalase \u2014 Catalase is an enzyme that breaks down hydrogen peroxide, helping bacteria resist oxidative stress. *Neisseria gonorrhoeae* does not produce catalase, which is a key point. In fact, it is catalase-negative, which is a diagnostic feature. So this is incorrect.\n\nC. Inhibition of B-lymphocyte function \u2014 This would impair antibody production, but there is no evidence that *N. gonorrhoeae* directly inhibits B cells.\n\nD. Inhibition of T-lymphocyte function \u2014 Again, no known direct mechanism of *N. gonorrhoeae* to inhibit T cells.\n\nHowever, despite the lack of classic antigenic variation, *N. gonorrhoeae* can persist due to its ability to evade immune responses, including antigenic variation in some surface antigens (like pili and outer membrane proteins), though this is not the most prominent feature.\n\nBut here's the key: the most accurate answer among the choices that explains **reinfection** is not direct immune suppression, but rather the organism's ability to **avoid immune detection** through **antigenic variation** in its surface antigens. Though not as well-documented as in other pathogens, *N. gonorrhoeae* does exhibit limited antigenic variation in its outer membrane proteins, which contributes to immune evasion and reinfection.\n\nThus, among the given options, **A. Antigenic variation** is the best explanation for reinfection in this context, even if it's not the most prominent mechanism.\n\nThe answer is (A)",
