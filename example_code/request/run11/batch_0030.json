        "text": "The patient is a 16-year-old girl who shared a hotel room with a person diagnosed with meningococcal meningitis. She has no symptoms and normal vital signs and physical exam findings. The concern is about possible exposure to Neisseria meningitidis, which is a serious bacterial infection that can lead to meningitis or septicemia.\n\nIn the setting of close contact with a person with meningococcal disease, especially in a shared environment like a hotel room, post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is recommended for individuals who are at risk of infection but are asymptomatic.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines:\n- For individuals with close contact (e.g., shared living space, sexual contact, or household exposure) with a person with meningococcal disease, **rifampin** is recommended as post-exposure prophylaxis for persons who are not immunocompromised and who are not at high risk for meningococcal disease.\n- Rifampin is effective in preventing meningococcal disease in such exposures.\n- Doxycycline or penicillin are not first-line for post-exposure prophylaxis in this context.\n- The meningococcal vaccine (option A) is not indicated for post-exposure prophylaxis; it is preventive for unexposed individuals and is not used after exposure.\n- Penicillin and doxycycline are used for treatment of active meningococcal disease, not prophylaxis after exposure.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate intervention in this asymptomatic, exposed individual is **rifampin**.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

I\u2019m [Your Name], and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to share a lot of laughs, a few late-night beers, and countless awkward moments with [Groom\u2019s Name] over the years. From our first trip to the local brewery to the time he tried to teach me how to play guitar and ended up sounding like a confused raccoon, I\u2019ve come to know that [Groom\u2019s Name] isn\u2019t just kind\u2014he\u2019s genuinely thoughtful, patient, and always ready to show up for someone, even when they\u2019re being a little ridiculous.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s [Bride\u2019s Name]. She\u2019s the one who always remembers your favorite sandwich, the one who laughs at the most random things, and the one who makes every moment feel like a little celebration. I\u2019ll never forget the time we all got lost on a hike and ended up at a roadside diner\u2014she was the one who said, \u2018Let\u2019s just enjoy the view and order the fries.\u2019 That\u2019s the spirit we\u2019re celebrating tonight.\n\nSo, to [Groom\u2019s Name] and [Bride\u2019s Name]\u2014may your love grow stronger with every sunrise, may your home always be filled with laughter, and may every challenge you face be met with the same warmth and courage you\u2019ve shown each other.

I\u2019m [Your Name], and I\u2019ve known [Bride\u2019s Name] since we were both knee-high to grass\u2014she\u2019s always been the one who sees the beauty in the little things: the way sunlight hits the porch, the way a song can make someone smile, or how a simple 'thank you' can mean the world. And when she met [Groom\u2019s Name], I didn\u2019t just see a partner\u2014I saw a match made in the stars.\n\nI remember the first time we all went to that tiny bookstore in the corner of town. [Groom\u2019s Name] was reading a book about gardening, and [Bride\u2019s Name] just looked at him and said, \u2018That\u2019s the kind of person I want to grow with.\u2019 I still get chills thinking about that moment. They\u2019ve built a quiet, beautiful rhythm together\u2014supportive, patient, full of kindness.\n\nSo to [Bride\u2019s Name] and [Groom\u2019s Name], I wish you a future filled with shared dreams, quiet mornings, and the kind of love that doesn\u2019t need a spotlight to shine.

        "text": "Surfactant is a substance produced by type II alveolar cells in the lungs. Its primary function is to reduce surface tension within the alveoli, which prevents alveolar collapse (atelectasis), especially during exhalation. By reducing surface tension, surfactant helps keep the alveoli open and stable, ensuring that the alveolar-capillary membrane remains intact and functional for efficient gas exchange, including oxygen diffusion.\n\nWhile oxygen diffusion itself is a passive process that depends on the integrity of the alveolar-capillary membrane, surfactant does not directly increase permeability or dilate blood vessels. Instead, its key role is in maintaining alveolar patency.\n\nOption A (increases surface permeability) is incorrect because surfactant reduces surface tension, not increases permeability. Option C (depresses cilia) is unrelated. Option D (dilates blood vessels) is not a known function of surfactant.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is (B)",

It yields about 37 kJ/g (9 kcal/g) when fully oxidized \u2014 significantly more than glucose due to the high number of carbon atoms and the energy stored in fatty acid bonds.\n- Leucine (C): An essential amino acid; yields about 15 kJ/g (4 kcal/g) \u2014 less than glucose or fatty acids.\n- Alcohol (D): Ethanol, when metabolized, yields about 29 kJ/g (7 kcal/g) \u2014 less than fatty acids and comparable to or less than glucose.\n\nFatty acids, such as palmitic acid, have a higher energy yield per gram than carbohydrates or proteins because they contain more reduced carbon atoms and store more chemical energy in their hydrocarbon chains. The oxidation of palmitic acid through beta-oxidation produces a large number of acetyl-CoA molecules, each feeding into the citric acid cycle to generate substantial ATP.\n\nThus, palmitic acid releases the most energy per gram when completely oxidized.\n\nThe answer is (B)",
