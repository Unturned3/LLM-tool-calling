        "text": "David is described as a perfectionist who compares himself to better players and is very hard on himself when he cannot master a section of a piece. This suggests that he has high standards and may struggle with self-acceptance when he fails, which is indicative of low self-esteem. \n\nSelf-efficacy refers to one\u2019s belief in their ability to succeed in specific situations. David is striving to master difficult music and is pushing himself, which suggests he believes in his ability to improve and perform \u2014 indicating strong self-efficacy.\n\nLocus of control refers to whether a person believes events in their life are controlled by internal factors (e.g., their own efforts) or external factors (e.g., luck, others' actions). David compares himself to better players and is hard on himself when he fails \u2014 this reflects a belief that his outcomes are due to his own efforts and abilities, which is an internal locus of control.\n\nTherefore, the best description is: low self-esteem (due to self-criticism), strong self-efficacy (due to effort and belief in mastery), and internal locus of control (believing outcomes are due to personal actions).\n\nThe answer is (A) is incorrect because it says high self-esteem, which contradicts the self-criticism described.\n\nThe answer is (B) \u2014 high self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control \u2014 is plausible, but the self-criticism and comparison to others suggest low self-esteem.\n\nThe answer is (C) \u2014 low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, external locus of control \u2014 contradicts the internal focus on personal effort.\n\nThe answer is (D) \u2014 low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, internal locus of control \u2014 contradicts the strong effort and belief in mastery.\n\nTherefore, despite the low self-esteem, the strong belief in his ability to master music and the internal attribution of success point to strong self-efficacy and internal control. However, the most accurate match based on the description is that he has low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, and internal locus of control.\n\nThus, the correct choice is:\n\nThe answer is (A) is incorrect due to high self-esteem.\n\nWait \u2014 none of the options exactly match low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control.\n\nLooking again:\n\nOption A: Low self-esteem, strong self-efficacy, internal locus of control \u2192 This matches the description.\n\nYes \u2014 that is exactly what we deduced.\n\nSo despite the perfectionism and self-criticism (low self-esteem), he is pushing himself and believes he can master the music (strong self-efficacy), and attributes outcomes to his own efforts (internal locus of control).\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nThe answer is (A)",
