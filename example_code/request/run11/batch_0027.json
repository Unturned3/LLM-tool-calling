This indicates that his body has effectively maintained blood glucose levels despite the absence of food intake.\n\nLet\u2019s evaluate the options:\n\nA. Continued gut absorption of calories from the ingested meal \u2014 This is not possible after 12 hours. The meal has been digested and absorbed, and the gut has completed its processing. No further absorption occurs after this time.\n\nB. Glucose release from skeletal muscle \u2014 Skeletal muscle does not release glucose into the bloodstream under normal conditions. It can take up glucose from the blood, but it does not release it into circulation. This is not a primary mechanism for maintaining serum glucose.\n\nC. Glycogenolysis in the liver \u2014 This is a key mechanism for maintaining blood glucose during fasting. After a meal, blood glucose is high, and glycogen is stored in the liver. During fasting, the liver breaks down stored glycogen into glucose and releases it into the bloodstream to maintain normal serum glucose levels. This occurs over several hours and is essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis during the postprandial to fasting phase.\n\nD. Increased leptin release from adipose tissues \u2014 Leptin is released in response to increased fat stores and suppresses appetite, but it does not directly regulate serum glucose concentration. It plays a role in energy balance, not glucose homeostasis.\n\nTherefore, the most likely mechanism maintaining serum glucose concentration after 12 hours without food is glycogenolysis in the liver.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
