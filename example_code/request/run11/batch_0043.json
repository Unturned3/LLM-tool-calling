        "text": "The key features in this case include:\n\n- Increased facial hair (hirsutism)\n- Amenorrhea (last menstrual period 4 months ago)\n- Clitoral enlargement (a sign of virilization)\n- Elevated serum testosterone\n- Normal levels of androstenedione, DHEA, and urinary 17-ketosteroids (ruling out adrenal source of androgens)\n- A 12-cm ovarian mass\n\nThe absence of elevated adrenal androgens (like androstenedione and DHEA) suggests that the androgen excess is not of adrenal origin. The elevated testosterone and clinical signs of virilization point to a **ovarian source** of androgens.\n\nAmong ovarian tumors, **Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors** are known to secrete testosterone and are the most common cause of ovarian androgen excess. These tumors are typically benign and can present with hirsutism, virilization, and clitoral enlargement.\n\n- Granulosa cell tumors typically secrete estrogen (can cause endometrial hyperplasia, not androgen excess).\n- Ovarian carcinoid tumors secrete serotonin, not androgens.\n- Teratomas are germ cell tumors and are not typically associated with androgen production.\n\nTherefore, the most likely diagnosis is a **Sertoli-Leydig tumor**.\n\nThe answer is (C)",

        "prompt": "The following is a multiple choice question (with answers) about  professional medicine.  Output the answer in the format of \"The answer is (X)\" at the end.\n\nQuestion: A 40-year-old woman comes to the physician because of a 6-month history of increased facial hair growth. Her last menstrual period was 4 months ago. She is 165 cm (5 ft 5 in) tall and weighs 70 kg (154 lb); BMI is 26 kg/m2 . Her pulse is 80/min, and blood pressure is 130/82 mm Hg. Physical examination shows temporal balding and coarse dark hair on the upper lip and chin. Pelvic examination shows clitoral enlargement. Her serum testosterone concentration is increased. Serum concentrations of androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone, and urinary 17-ketosteroids are within the reference ranges. Ultrasonography of the pelvis shows a 12-cm ovarian mass. Which of the following best describes this mass?\n Options:\nA. Granulosa tumor\nB. Ovarian carcinoid\nC. Sertoli-Leydig tumor\nD. Teratoma\nAnswer:",

        "text": "[Exhibition Catalog: \"Forms in Time \u2013 Sculptures of Five Masters\"]\n\n1. **Auguste Rodin**  \nRodin (1840\u20131917) revolutionized sculpture with expressive bronze and marble. His mastery of texture and movement, as in *The Thinker*, broke traditional forms. Using wax and clay, he emphasized emotion and fluidity, redefining the human figure through dynamic, unfinished surfaces.\n\n2. **Anish Kapoor**  \nAnish Kapoor (b. 1954) commands space with polished stainless steel and concrete. Works like *Cloud Gate* exploit reflective surfaces and gravity. His technique fuses minimalism with monumental presence, creating immersive, site-specific forms that challenge perception and light.\n\n3. **Henry Moore**  \nHenry Moore (1903\u20131986) explored organic forms in bronze and stone. His *Reclining Figure* series embodies fluid, amoebic shapes. Using negative space and abstraction, Moore fused naturalism with modernist geometry, achieving emotional depth through soft, curving forms.\n\n4. **Niki de Saint Phalle**  \nNiki de Saint Phalle (1931\u20132002) fused color and myth in vibrant fiberglass and concrete. Her *Tarot* series uses bold forms and symbolic motifs. Her technique blends surrealism with feminist expression, transforming sculpture into joyful, defiant art.\n\n5. **David Smith**  \nDavid Smith (1906\u20131975) mastered abstract steel sculpture. His *Gate* series uses welded iron and industrial forms. Through precision welding and geometric abstraction, Smith transformed industrial materials into expressive, kinetic structures embodying modernist strength and innovation.",
