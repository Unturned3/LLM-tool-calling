It reflects the cellular energy status and is calculated as:\n\nEnergy charge = [ATP + 0.5 \u00d7 ADP] / [ATP + ADP + AMP]\n\nThis represents the extent to which the total adenine nucleotide pool is phosphorylated.\n\nOption A refers to membrane potential, not energy charge.  \nOption B, sodium-potassium ATPase, generates membrane potential and uses ATP but does not define energy charge.  \nOption C refers to metabolic rate, not energy charge.  \nOption D correctly describes energy charge.\n\nThe answer is (D)",
