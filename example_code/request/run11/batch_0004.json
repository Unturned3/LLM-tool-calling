Key features include:\n\n- Painless bilateral ankle swelling (edema)\n- Dyspnea on exertion and orthopnea (waking up short of breath)\n- Elevated jugular venous pressure (15 cm H\u2082O, which is elevated)\n- Crackles at lung bases (pulmonary congestion)\n- Soft S3 gallop (indicative of left ventricular dysfunction)\n- Holosystolic murmur at apex (suggestive of mitral regurgitation)\n- 2+ pitting edema\n\nThese findings strongly suggest systolic heart failure, likely due to left ventricular dysfunction.\n\nTo confirm the diagnosis, especially to assess left ventricular function, ejection fraction, and structural abnormalities (such as mitral regurgitation), echocardiography is the most appropriate and definitive test.\n\nWhile:\n- Serum troponin I (A) can detect myocardial injury, but it does not confirm heart failure or assess ventricular function.\n- ECG (B) may show signs of left ventricular hypertrophy or ischemia, but it is non-specific and not diagnostic of heart failure.\n- Exercise stress test (C) is useful for assessing functional capacity and ischemia, but not for confirming the diagnosis of heart failure.\n\nEchocardiography directly evaluates ventricular function, wall motion, valve function, and can confirm the presence of systolic dysfunction.\n\nThe answer is (D)",

She also reports shortness of breath with exertion and when lying down. She has been awakened from sleep by shortness of breath. She has not had chest pain. Her pulse is 96/min and regular, respirations are 24/min, and blood pressure is 128/76 mm Hg. Jugular venous pressure is 15 cm H2O. Pulmonary examination shows crackles at both lung bases. Cardiac examination shows a regular rhythm and a soft S3. A grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur is heard best at the apex, radiating to the axilla. There is 2+ pitting edema of the lower legs and ankles. Which of the following is most likely to confirm the diagnosis?\n Options:\nA. Measurement of serum troponin I concentration\nB. ECG\nC. Exercise stress test\nD. Echocardiography\nAnswer:",

A diastolic murmur can be due to aortic regurgitation in dissection, and decreased pulses are common due to dissection involving the descending aorta.\n\nAcute myocardial infarction (A) would typically present with ST elevation or ST depression, Q waves, and possibly arrhythmias, but the ECG shows left ventricular hypertrophy, not acute infarction.
