        "text": "Anaerobic metabolism refers to the generation of ATP in the absence of oxygen. While it does not require oxygen, it is not necessarily dependent on glycogen (which can be used in both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism), and it does involve ADP (in fact, ADP is a substrate in ATP synthesis). The key defining feature of anaerobic metabolism is that it occurs without the use of oxygen, which is the primary distinction from aerobic metabolism.\n\nOption C (\"without the use of oxygen\") and D (\"in the absence of available oxygen\") are both close, but \"without the use of oxygen\" is more precise and commonly used in biochemical definitions. However, \"in the absence of available oxygen\" is more clinically and physiologically accurate, as it reflects the actual physiological condition.\n\nBut in standard medical and biochemical terminology, anaerobic metabolism is defined as ATP production without oxygen \u2014 so the best answer is:\n\nC. without the use of oxygen.\n\nThe answer is (C)",
