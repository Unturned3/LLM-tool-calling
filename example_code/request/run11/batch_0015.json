        "text": "The patient is experiencing poor pain control with codeine, and there is a family history of poor response to codeine. Codeine is a prodrug that is metabolized primarily in the liver by the enzyme CYP2D6 to morphine, which is the active analgesic component. Individuals who are poor metabolizers of CYP2D6 (due to genetic polymorphisms) produce little to no morphine from codeine, leading to inadequate pain relief.\n\nThis condition is known as \"poor metabolizer\" status and is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Since multiple family members also have poor pain control, this strongly suggests a genetic deficiency in CYP2D6 activity, leading to decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine.\n\nOption A (decreased absorption) is unlikely because codeine is well absorbed orally and would not explain a familial pattern.\n\nOption B (decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine) directly correlates with poor pain control in poor CYP2D6 metabolizers and fits the clinical scenario and family history.\n\nOption C (deficiency of \u03ba receptors) is not relevant to codeine's mechanism; codeine primarily acts via morphine, which acts on \u03bc-opioid receptors, not \u03ba receptors.\n\nOption D (increased plasma protein-binding) would typically lead to reduced free drug availability, but not in a familial, predictable pattern like this.\n\nTherefore, the most likely explanation is a defect in the metabolic pathway of codeine to morphine.\n\nThe answer is (B)",

The patient was prescribed codeine after the procedure and instructed to take the medication every 4 hours, but she has continued pain despite adherence to this analgesic regimen. Other members of her family also have experienced poor pain control with codeine. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this therapeutic failure?\n Options:\nA. Decreased absorption of codeine\nB. Decreased metabolism of codeine to morphine\nC. Deficiency of \u03ba receptors\nD. Increased plasma protein-binding of codeine\nAnswer:",
