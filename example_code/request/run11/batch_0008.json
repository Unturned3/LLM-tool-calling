        "text": "The patient presents with urinary frequency and incontinence that occur specifically before and after air travel, with symptoms resolving after arrival. The symptoms are linked to travel and anxiety, and they are not present otherwise. The fact that they occur before flights and are associated with anxiety suggests a psychogenic origin, possibly related to the stress of flying. The absence of organic abnormalities (normal urinalysis, urine culture, physical exam) makes a medical cause unlikely. The symptoms are temporally associated with stress and anxiety, and the patient reports anxiety and panic.\n\nAmong the options:\n\nA. Recommend behavioral therapy \u2014 This is appropriate for managing anxiety-related urinary symptoms, especially when stress is a trigger. Behavioral therapy (e.g., cognitive-behavioral therapy) is effective for stress-induced urinary symptoms and can address both the anxiety and the physical symptoms.\n\nB. Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy \u2014 This is less appropriate and not typically first-line for acute, stress-related symptoms. It is more suited for chronic, complex psychological issues.\n\nC. Recommend that the patient avoid any stressful activities \u2014 This is not practical or effective in the long term and may not address the underlying issue.\n\nD. Review the patient's sexual history \u2014 There is no indication of a sexual health concern; the symptoms are not related to sexual activity.\n\nThe most appropriate next step is to address the psychological component, particularly the stress and anxiety that precede the symptoms. Behavioral therapy is a targeted, evidence-based intervention for stress-induced urinary symptoms.\n\nThe answer is (A)",

She says the urinary symptoms typically begin a few days before she is going to fly and they stop the day after she arrives at her destination. She says she is anxious about flying and even slightly \"panicky.\" She reports having had similar but milder symptoms prior to examinations before graduating. Medical history is otherwise unremarkable. Her only medication is an oral contraceptive. Vital signs are normal. Physical examination discloses no abnormalities. Urinalysis and urine culture are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step?\n Options:\nA. Recommend behavioral therapy\nB. Recommend psychoanalytic psychotherapy\nC.

These blisters result from adhesion failure between keratinocytes in the epidermis, which is mediated by the desmosomal adhesion complex at the basement membrane zone.\n\nHowever, the question specifically asks about \"adhesion failure involving which of the following?\" and the options are:\n\nA. Basement membrane  \nB. Dermal papillae  \nC. Langerhans cells  \nD. Melanocytes  \n\nThe basement membrane is a structural component that separates the epidermis from the dermis and is not the site of the intercellular adhesion failure in blistering diseases like pemphigus. In pemphigus, the failure occurs between keratinocytes due to desmosomal adhesion, not at the basement membrane.\n\nDermal papillae are involved in dermal-epidermal attachment but not in the adhesion failure causing blisters in flexural areas.\n\nLangerhans cells are antigen-presenting cells and not involved in adhesion.\n\nMelanocytes produce melanin and are not involved in epidermal adhesion.\n\nHowever, the most relevant structure in the context of epidermal adhesion failure\u2014particularly in blistering diseases\u2014is the **basement membrane**, although technically, the adhesion failure in pemphigus occurs at the **desmosomes** between keratinocytes, not at the basement membrane.\n\nBut among the listed choices, **the basement membrane** is the closest to being a structural interface involved in epithelial integrity. However, in pemphigus foliaceus, the blistering occurs due to **loss of desmosomal adhesion**, not basement membrane adhesion.\n\nBut wait\u2014there is a key point: blister formation in flexural areas with non-breaking blisters and no oral lesions is more consistent with **pemphigus foliaceus**, which involves **desmosomal adhesion failure** between keratinocytes.\n\nBut none of the listed options directly mention desmosomes.\n\nThe basement membrane is the interface between epidermis and dermis. Adhesion failure at the basement membrane (as in bullous pemphigoid) causes blisters, and bullous pemphigoid is characterized by blisters in flexural areas, non-breaking, and often with a history of chronicity.\n\nBullous pemphigoid involves autoantibodies against **basement membrane zone antigens** (like BP180 and BP230), leading to blister formation due to **adhesion failure at the basement membrane**.\n\nIn contrast, pemphigus foliaceus involves **desmosomal** adhesion failure, not basement membrane.\n\nThe question says: \"blister formation... most numerous in flexural areas including axillae and groin. The blisters do not break easily\" \u2014 this is classic for **bullous pemphigoid**, which is associated with **adhesion failure at the basement membrane**.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\nA. Basement membrane\n\nThe answer is (A)",
